The beginning of the film does an amazing play by play recap of the fire. It highlights very well how it got out of control before anyone even knew it. It does a great job of using real footage and commentary when the fire was actually raging. It combines real footage with commentary for a very good viewing experience.  The film also provided a very smooth transition from the story telling of the fire to the academic information of how climate change has resulted in an increase of wildfires. Prolonged drought, and longer summers, makes it a nightmare for potential wildfires. I couldn't believe how horrible it was to watch the hospital get evacuated. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to have to get evaced straight after surgery. However, you can really see how some people rise to the occasion as some doctors and nurses used their personal cars to evacuate patients.  
<br><br>

Before the film, I knew that fires were a major issue, however, I honestly did not think it could result in this major of human devastation. I thought everyone just drives away and the worst thing that could happen is your house burning down and losing all your possessions. Through the film I learned that even in America, wildfires can result is death and destruction of many levels way more than just a house and possessions. The fact that 85 people died from a preventable fire caused by a corporation is deeply concerning and sad. This film does a great job using human stories and real time footage to display the horrible effects that wildfires can have.

I agree. I think the film was really well done and I feel like I got to learn about the fire from different perspectives. I did feel like some parts of the film were difficult to watch and did not expect to feel so many emotions throughout the viewing. Like you mentioned I thought it was kind that doctors and nurses used their own cars as a mode of transportation for patients. It is really difficult to imagine what the situation is like first hand but the interviews from people really helped in capturing the emotion. I feel like everything happened so quickly and it was a wake up call as to how quickly everything could change for someone.

I agree with what you have written above. This documentary was incredibly produced and had me extremely engaged. I agree as well that the transition to the academic side was done perfectly and highlighted the things that could've been done differently. I have friends that go to school in Santa Cruz and was confused when they told me they had their power shut off to prevent fires. After this video however, I see exactly why those precautionary steps are taken.
<br><br>


I believed, before watching this video, that I knew the possibilities of the type of damage a fire could cause but boy was I wrong. The last few years with the fires so close to Santa Barbara, I think we are becoming more aware of the possibilities and just how real of a problem this is.
<br><hr>
I agree.  The film does an amazing job capturing the devastation that a wildfire can bring especially on a town that isn't prepared.  The footage used from the first-person perspectives of the police and the shots on people's phones and cameras really brought a sense that you were there along for the tragedy that the citizens of Paradise had to go through.  Like you mentioned this makes for a great intro into the talk of climate change as the audience just witnessed all the hardships the people went through because of one wildfire.  The film then goes further and adds the statistic that the 4 largest fires in California history happened over the last 4 years.  This shows the obvious correlation between these natural disasters and climate-changing as the only logical explanation for the rapid increase in deadly fires is due to the rising temperatures.  I had the same feeling as you when I saw this film because before watching this as I thought that wildfires were way below the likes of earthquakes and hurricanes in terms of destructive force.  But after watching this movie it almost makes me afraid to live in California especially since one of the biggest 4 fires in California history happened in Santa Barbara.  It makes me think back to the end of last year when there was a fire close to the  UCSB campus.  I probably should have been more worried than I was which was not at all.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said. When I finished the film, I felt so sorry about that. I was shocked too to see how the wildfire can spread so fast that cost so many people’s life. Be honestly, I can not imagine climate change would have such more influence on the earth. It is horrible to know so much people dead in this incident. But in another way it maybe teach people a lesson. Whatever, it was good to watch the film.
<br><hr>
I too was under the impression that it is simple to evacuate everyone and avoid a fire all with limited consequences. I suppose that that is the difference between simulation (fire drills) and real life. When they were showing the evacuation, I had the same thoughts as the young woman: "Why isn't everyone moving as fast as they can away from the fire??" The roads were just too clogged... It is devastating to hear about the 85 people that died during the fire, especially when you see their family members recounting their experience as the fire was going and when they heard the news about their loved ones. But I also think that the inclusion of the happy stories was necessary (such as the nurse that was saved and later reunited with her husband. It shows that even though there was so much destruction there is still something good to be gleaned - and that we can prevail over today's circumstances. This fire could have been prevented, and we should work towards completely preventing future ones by working on climate and corporation issues.
<br><br>


I agree that the way the film was structured was very good. They use the personal stories of the victims of the 2018 fire to boost the message that we need to find a way to stop these fires. I am glad that they mention that these fires are being worsened by climate change since it ties back to the reason I watched the film - Climate Crisis 101. This information also brings people's attention to and connects the climate crisis and the horrible devastation that they just witnessed.
<br><hr>
I agree with with comment. This is actually a very well-plan film. I think the use of time while show how the fire spread to the town paradise. With these times showing on the screen, I, as a audience, can easily figure out how fast the spread at that time, because the time and the numbers are the more convincing evidence. Moreover, the part of interviewing many of the different people of different jobs, who really experienced the fire, from different perspectives, such as 911, victims, nurse, and firefighters. The point of view of all these witnesses are direct and more persuasive than anything else. 
<br><br>
After watching, this film, for the first time, I really feel how it is like and the dangerous wild fires. These makes me better realize the seriousness of the bad results of climate crisis, and it make me better feel the emergence of take action immediately is very important, because all these catastrophic result are now happening in our real lives that destroyed a lot things and lives.

<br><hr>
I think you make a lot of really good points that I agree with. The movie does a really good job showing the different perspectives of the Camp Fire and how it happened so suddenly, due to PG&E's equipment failure, and when no one was anticipating it. This was especially sad for me because, as I watched the real footage and commentary of the fire, I realized this is the new reality we live in. As Southern California becomes hotter and drier the chance of fires continues to increase and they can come at a moments notice and they can move at quick speeds if the winds are strong enough. As I watched the film, I was reminded of the human devastation fires have like you were. I am from Boston, so fires have never personally impacted me, but it made me think of when I first visited Santa Barbara looking at schools. I was driving through Montecido with my mom and I remember seeing whole houses that had tumbled down the hills in ruins with debris and huge rocks everywhere. Now that I am here, in a place where fires are a constant problem due to climate change, I am a lot more aware of how climate has directly impacted US citizens in different ways across the entire country.

After watching the incredible film “Fire in Paradise '' I was shocked at how naive I was at the reality of wildfires. This film does a great job of emcompasses the true reality of a wildfire and the emotion that comes with it. The fact that 85 people lost their lives was shocking to me. Like you said the worst that can happen is you lose your house and possessions. Not having any personal experience with wildfires has made me close minded on the issue. I can not imagine this happening to me therefore seeing people be able to quickly jump into the swing of things and help others was astonishing. I now realize the horrific reality of human devastation due to wildfires. Climate changes irrefutable tie to wildfires is clear more than ever before. The ice caps are not just melting and sea levels are not just rising, our earth is burning. The statistics of California wildfires are terrifying. I should be more prepared for the danger that I may face living in Santa Barbara.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said. I have heard about fires that devastate entire towns, and when you hear about it, it tugs on your heart strings. However, Fire in Paradise really hits differently. I was shocked at how personal the interviews felt and how the movie evokes such a strong feeling of empathy. I was taken aback with how quickly this fire really got out of hand. I agree that the movie did a fantastic job, even using the specific first responders who took the calls, to show just how quickly it spread without warning. 
<br><br>

The movie makes it a lot about the people who lost in the fire but it makes sure to also focus on the people who have to brave the fire on the front lines. The first responder who suddenly realized the fire was etremely close to her own house, I couldnt even imagine the pain and panic you must feel when you are having to watch this deadly fire unhinge, while being unable to get the things you care about out of the way. Again, the movie does a great job illuminating how the people who respond to these fires are again the same people who are losing their belongings because they have to be the first ones on the scene. They showed this in the aftermath when the first responder wished he had had time to get home and save his family photos and the cat. The personal loss is extreme from these fires. 
<br><br>
I think the people on the fire and rescue teams is the most important thing the movie highlights. A lot of the time we focus on the body count or on the structures lost and we thank the first responders but we dont really dive into the personal stories. Seeing just how much this affects the responders is a humbling feeling and seeing just how much they have to sacrifice to keep others safe fills me with sadness.

<br><hr>
Ya I also found it interesting how they highlighted how the fire got out of control before anyone even knew it. I feel like we find that same underlying idea with the climate crisis in its entirety. It has gotten out of control without us even noticing, and yet we probably won't fully realize its ramifications until it hits us right in the face. 

<br><br>

I found it unsettling how the fire started so small and quickly expanded and ravaged through the town. Like the film notes, prolonged droughts and longer summers make for a destructive wildfire. It was frustrating as a viewer to watch the fire expand and travel toward the town knowing that none of the residents were evacuating. I can't imagine the road rage and the overall terror everyone was feeling as they were finally driving out of town and the streets were enveloped in fire. 

<br><br>

The climate crisis is HERE in California and this is just the beginning. I think back to the article that we read the first week by David Wallace-Wells listing the impending effects that will occur if we don't take action immediately. I'd like to think that he was correct in saying that the effects of global warming won't all occur because humans will step up and prevent it, because we see already see people in Paradise making a change in mindset after this fire.

<br><hr>
I think the film was also very well made and informative. I was kind of surprised by home emotional the film made me. I think it's because I never really took the time to imagine what being in such a massive and chaotic situation would be like. The part with the hospital was especially hard to watch. As I was watching the footage, seeing people in wheelchairs coming out of the hospital with the dark sky above them, I remembered that it was still early in the morning. People must have been so confused waking up that morning if no one had told them what was happening. I feel like this must have been the situation for most people because of the fact that a lot of people weren't signed up for the code red alert and the evacuation for the whole town didn't come for awhile after the fire ignited. I can see how many of the first responders in the situation must feel guilt for not acting fast enough, although they still did save a lot of people. PG&E literally could not care less, just about the amount of money they are losing. Who cares about the money, people lost their family and homes. Although someone like me is barely being informed on the issue, these people have had parts of their lives missing for 2 years. As much as the city prepared for big fires and evacuations, not everything can be controlled or foreseen. This situation will be the first of many within the coming years. Extreme weather is unpredictable and it will probably be difficult to create safety plans. There was a tornado warning in Santa Barbara, I doubt there is a written safety plan for a situation like that.
<br><hr>
I agree that the film did a fantastic job; in setting the stage, showing how the fire quickly became out of control, knowing the time line of how quickly it spread, hearing the calls from the emergency hotline. It did a wonderful job of getting that feeling of fear, urgency, confusion, etc. that everyone in the area must have been feeling. More than once I was overcome with emotion. I am from CA, I am from the Mojave Desert though, so while it is a dry climate, I have never had to deal with the threat of fire. I have always felt so distant from it. Even in 2017, my freshman year when finals were cancelled because of the poor air quality, the Thompson fire felt distant. 
<br><br>
This film made wildfires real for me. I felt the panic, I felt the anxiety, I am at a loss for words. I have always thought that it would be easy to evacuate in case of fire, I always thought that it would be rushed, sure, but able to get everyone to safety. This film struck me with not only fear, but grief and guilt. I can't help but think about how dying in a fire must be so terrifying. 
<br><br>
After watching this film, knowing that these events are not only more likely, but heightened as a result of the climate crisis is all the more disturbing. And I feel a strong call to action, even though the film did not call for one; no one deserves to have to go through such intense events as a result of the negligence of the developed world. I reject the idea that these events are simply nature and cannot be stopped, or decreased.
<br><hr>
I guess it’s also hard to comprehend for myself because I’ve only ever seen a catastrophic like in movies and things of the sort. My experience of wildfire are just the scorched ground that I sometimes drive past so this film really burned a image of just how bad things could get. One of the things that made me mad was that PGE faced no consequence over this. Who cares that they’re a corporation a not a person, there has to be corporate accountability here.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. I too felt as if I was living this devastating disaster.  think it is important to watch this film because it touches many subjects, from miscommunication among inhabitants of a town to evacuation plans. Being from Pomona, a city in southern California, I have never experienced a fire like the ones sparked here in the north of the state. The most I have ever seen is a cloud of dark smoke coming from one house, and the only reason I knew about it is because everyone posted about it on social media, since it is very rare to see even a small fire where I am from. This documentary made me reflect on my life back home and the fact that there is yet another disaster we have dodged. It makes me feel fortunate that I live in a place that doesn't see a lot of natural disasters. 
<br><br>
As I was watching this film, I felt like I was living through the Camp Fire. The part that angered me was towards the end, where PG&E denied its knowledge about possible consequences of its old power lines. This makes me think about the role that older generations play in the climate crisis, as they deny or at least refuse to realize the significance of their actions and past behavior. I think it is important for communities to push their inhabitants to watch this documentary to demonstrate the risks of fires. Throughout the documentary, the Camp Fire is described as “the most destructive fire in California’s history”. As explained in this film, many contributing factors came together to create such a devastating catastrophe. However, climate change was mentioned many times as the foundation for the grand size of the Camp Fire. Even though the film as a whole is not meant to focus on the climate crisis or what we can do to combat it, this just shows that climate change does in fact play a role
<br><br>
 in the most devastating natural disasters.
<br><hr>
I really resonate with the point that you made about not realizing the impact fires have on humans. I feel like many people, myself included, often think of fires as natural disasters that mostly affect landscapes and animals. On the contrary, humans are also greatly affected by wildfires. I really like the way that the film shows just how disastrous fires can be for humans. I also really liked how the film showed the support that community members gave each other during such a horrific time.
<br><hr>
This comment summed up everything that I needed to say after watching this documentary. I agree with the idea that it was filmed very well and the inclusion of real footage helped for sure. For me what was really mind opening about this documentary was watching how fast it spread and how many people were affected by it. I have never experienced a wildfire before but like you said, I personally always thought they were just things you could run away from and easily escape. This documentary showed how ignorant that belief is as 85 people lost their lives to a fire caused by an old transmission line. Not only did this documentary show how dangerous the fire was and how quickly it affected people's lives but it also showed how difficult it was for fire fighters and police officers to coordinate an evacuation for a fire that was so big and fast spreading. I also thought that the documentary included effective stories about people from the fire to show how tragic this event was. The story of the girl who lost her mother, the family that lost their grandpa, and the hospital evacuation all were great examples of what is to come if we continue ignorantly adding to the climate crisis and not take care of our environment.
<br><hr>
I agree that I think the film did a very good job in describing the "play by play" of the fire. I admit that I would have thought that there would be some kind of all-knowing authority that was working on the situation, when in reality the film exposed how out of control, overrun, and chaotic most branches of public authority were in Paradise. For me, I think that this film invoked the "I want to curl up and cry" response because of how scary the events were, especially knowing that this may only worsen. Would people invoke change if they had to experience this? I imagine that the nurse who barely escaped the fire with her life would be a strong environmentalist now, but how do we invoke the same response in others? (Radical change #Bernie2020 #GND oops) I think that this film really allowed the viewer to get the full experience (the scare) and hopefully push them towards environmentalism. I am not sure how I feel about the electrical company dilemma...I do think that they are in the wrong and that they need to keep their equipment in working conditions, but at the same time I feel like shutting power on and off and spending fortunes on constant repairs is a lot for a company to take on. Especially because electricity is so incorporated into almost every single american's daily life. I think that the change needs to come from higher up, and then all companies will be forced to follow suit instead of making (or not making) their own choices. #Foodforthought
<br><hr>
ALSO 80 football fields a minute??? insane
<br><hr>
I agree that the visuals in this movie are unbelievable. It is crazy to think that an electrical explosion leaded to such a big wildfire. The scenes at the hospital when everyone was evacuating were scary and ember was flying around everywhere. The winds made this fire spread so fast, taking only 4 hours to burn down the whole city of Paradise. The phone calls from victims recorded by the police were interesting and sad to hear. Some families were unable to escape the fires and this was considered one of the most tragic fires in California's history. Because it was so unexpected and fast spreading it was hard for every in the city to evacuate at the same time. They did have designated zones and evacuation protocols that they followed. Some corporations definitely contributed to the greenhouse gas emissions, but they can not be completely responsible for an event like this. For the future, we need to find better ways of containing fires and more efficient ways of evacuating.
<br><hr>
In response to your comment, I agree that the rise of the climate crisis is indeed fueled by many corporations who believe in money more than they believe in saving the Earth. The rise of wildfires is pure evidence that global warming is happening at a rate almost too fast to slow down and that we should be more concerned before more wildlife is lost due to these fires. Also mentioned in your comment was how you didn’t know that fires could play such a profound impact on our planet as much as other natural disasters and I agree to that as well. Before I thought that sea level rises would be more of a cause of destruction but after watching this film, I now see that wildfires can cause just as much damage, if not more, to our species. This film was a real eye opener to the numerous lives lost because of corporation greed and how we as an entire planet need to work together both politically and environmentally to salvage whatever we can before it’s too late.
<br><hr>
I agree with everything you stated about the film. One statement I resonated with was how you did not truly know how devastating and destructive the wildfires are until watching the film. You never truly understand how detrimental the climate crisis is until you actually live through one of the disasters or are educated about it. 
<br><br>

The beginning of the film captivated the audience by giving personal experiences about how people remembering the fire starting. It started with a newscaster stating that there were extreme weather conditions and residents should take precaution. The film then slowly transitions into how destructive the Camp Fire got over a span of a few hours. The fact that Paradise residents had to change their whole life because of a wildfire that was preventable is mind-blowing to me. You truly do not know how catostrophic these disasters are until you think about the community and how much they have lost. The film did a great job of portraying the severity of the fire as well as spreading the message about the climate crisis. Overall, what this film showed me is that something needs to be changed in order to prevent these horrible disasters that are caused by climate change.
<br><hr>

I agree with your statement. I personally gained a new perspective because of the quality of the film. Being from Southern California, this fire specifically just felt like another fire. After watching the film I was amazed by how normalized these disasters have become in our state. I remember watching the news covering the fire but there was no sense of gravity over the fact that the fires killed so many people, and destroyed a whole town. It is time we start holding these companies accountable for the problems they create. They are destroying the land that we live in because of pure laziness and desire to stay up to code to prevent mishaps like this.
<br><hr>
Off the bat, this film was definitely eye-opening and heartbreaking for me, and I'm sure everyone else. From experience, coming from the Central Valley, I would always remember poor air quality growing up where ash was a major problem around the area I'm from. In elementary school, I remember class getting cancelled and in high school we couldn't even stay outside for too long during brunch and lunch breaks due to ash in the air. As a Californian, fires are a common subject that a lot of us may be used to. Initially, knowing how destructive fires are can be very scary especially what fires can do to an area; although, I agree that the film "Fire in Paradise" really opens your eyes on different aspects many people did not initially know about. The sad truth that this fire could have been preventable is very heartbreaking, many lives and houses could have been saved knowing that this fire could have been prevented. I have a friend that is from the area that this fire occurred and I will never forget the moment she told me that her own home was burned down with nothing left for her and her family. Watching the film and hearing about personal stories from this tragic event really makes you realize how blessed you are especially if you have never experienced something like this. I also agree that it is saddening that the fact that in the film when they stated that those who were in the hospital, had to evacuate. I could not imagine the fear and stress this tragic event brought upon everyone around this area, especially those in hospitals who are already most likely stressed with just being in the hospital in general. I hope that many that watch Fire in Paradise will finally come to conclusion that climate change is real and natural disasters that occur in the world is very traumatizing and can continue to occur in the near future.

<br><hr>
I agree. This documentary helps show our reality. I've only had to deal with smoke from fires, never the actual fire. Learning about the fire in paradise made me sad because all those people suffered due to mismanagement and climate change. I believe we need to be more prepared for these disasters because this is our reality. Fires. If I were in that position, I would not know what to do and would be very panicked. Ken's postscript about the Australia fire helped put things into perspective. It is so big, and I am wondering it isn't all we talk about, or at least more talked about. But at the same time I understand. It's so sad and big that we don't know what to do. Fire in paradise also connects to Wallace Well's article by depicting how hellish our present can be. Our future is not looking good. I am worried about fires.
 <br><br>

It felt unreal. Everything was so sad and stressful but also so close to home. That could be me. I am feeling very very worried. This film made me very sad, especially when the hospital staff tried to evacuate patients because of the fire. This connects to our reading of 2C because it shows that California is really not a safe place. We are being influenced by climate change, and we are dying because of it. I feel sad but also compelled to prevent this from happening again. We are well on the way to the third part of the Bosch painting that  DiCaprio talks about in his documentary. It’s easy to be mad at PG&E because it’s a direct cause. But it’s harder to blame fossil fuel companies, even though the richest 100 companies are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions, and a lot of them are fossil fuel based.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said before I watched the film. I just know the fire and know the negative impact that it will provide to us. But never have I ever taken the fire to relate with myself. Though we truly have experienced the mountain fire during the 2019 Thanksgiving. But I still believe that I am the lucky one and though there was having a real fire in Santa Barbara mountain. But it is still a lot of distance from where I am living in Isla Vista. 
 <br><br>
However, When I finished the film. I just fell so hopeless and afraid of the fire that I used to be fearless about. I wish to have a peaceful place without fire. Not only because I do not want my house to be destroyed by the house but also I do not want myself and the people I cared about to be harmed the air pollution and another negative impact caused by the fire.

<br><hr>
I definitely am in the same boat as your opinion above, I believe that the film showcases what actually happened and provided the public with some alarming consequences of climate change and firms' greediness. California is known for wildfires caused by the drought and longer summers. I believe we are barely prepared or, like the film highlighted to me at least, was that our preparation for such calamity is non existent. Furthermore, the whole incident could have been prevented if corporations such as PG&E did their job to replace their dinosaur-aged transmission towers. But then again, that is not the case for most corporations, corporations would rather procrastinate or do nothing, enough to see the whole world burn, just so they could minimize their cost and continuously earn their profits. I feel sorry and embarrassed to the residents of the area, to think that they couldn't do anything but either suffocate to death or had to go through frightening wildfires just to survive is extremely alarming not only to the state of California, but to the whole world.

 <br><br>

As for fires being a major issue, I also agree, I never thought that wildfires will result in major human devastation until I heard stories about the Thomas Fire that occurred in Santa Barbara two years ago, and the recent wildfire that is exponentially growing and affecting the country of Australia, as we speak. The film did an amazing job in portraying authentic human stories and footage that you have mentioned, I feel like all the film that was brought by this course had one intention in common, which is to spread the knowledge of climate change and at the same show the world that this is an ongoing issue that we all need to work together.
<br><hr>

The 2018 California wildfires shocked the world. And recently, the Australia Fire shocks the world again. I only know those events as the news. I barely can feel how those events are until I watch this film. People can never aware of the result of the climate crisis until the result of the crisis happens to them. This documentary is a really good resource to popularize the dangers of the climate crisis to people and how fast the climate crisis happens. Nowadays, people already feel numb with data or statistics. This kind of documentary with the use of pathos really can influence the audience with the emotion.  
 <br><br>


The documentary also discloses a fact that we are not ready for the climate crisis. The result of the climate crisis is unprecedented. The police tried to move people away from the hill but the load of the road is limited. The old people did not face this kind of situation before. The diaster is made by this unprecedented. Japan, which is a nation that always has an earthquake, can deal with the earthquake really well because everybody is told how to deal with the earthquake and every equipment is prepared for the earthquake. However, the climate crisis in the future will cause a lot of unprecedented situation in the place which never faces the situation before. We know there are a lot of tragic caused by the climate crisis will happen, but we can not prepare it. Most important is that we still do not aware of the ultimate cause of those tragic, the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said above. The film does a great job showing how fast the wildfire can spread and how devastating the scale of a wildfire could be. I was shocked by the recording when there is traffic congestion inside the wildfire. It is impossible to get out of that situation without a car and even people eventually made it would suffer from some sort of PTSD. 

 <br><br>

I used to think wildfire is controllable and people can put it down with water trucks. However, according to the video, the flames just gonna burn down everything on its way. Being inside a wildfire region is just like being in the inferno hell. Definitely horrifying.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your thoughts on how the film was actually made. While I was engaged because of the dramatic action and intense imagery, I was also as equally informed and motivated. When I saw these fires being broadcasted on the news and various social media sites—like Instagram and Twitter—I didn’t realize the impact it had on its local buildings and communities. Not only did this fire add to the detrimental effects of climate change, it also burned down several homes, schools, and even buildings as large as hospitals. These traumatic changes to the community is something that they cannot stand alone. Like you said, it’s more than “house and possessions.” Peoples lives are at risk because of certain corporations not caring about the effects they have on our planet. This short film does a great job at reminding us about what’s happening around us, and also about the communities that need us.
<br><hr>
I agree that this film did an incredible job of transitioning from real stories, footage, and recordings to scientific explanations for why a fire of this magnitude could happen. Hearing from all the people whose lives were devastated by this disaster had a huge emotional impact and gave faces to those who are being harmed by the climate crisis. While I have heard many of the scientific explanations before, this film helped connect these explanations to real consequences. Hearing from someone who had to run through fire with no guarantee of safety, or abandon her mom to die for fear of her own life, or be on the phone with people trapped in their home dying made the crisis seem more real to me.
 <br><br>


I have known for a long time that climate change was a serious issue. I have heard a lot of facts and numbers about rising temperatures and devastating natural disasters exacerbated by the climate crisis. But hearing those facts alongside real people's stories drove home how this crisis affects everyone and that it is happening right now. There are real consequences and it is not possible to just drive away and be okay. Unless we act now, no one will be safe from the effects of the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
Watching this film was — to put it bluntly — absolutely terrifying. It infuriates me that while there are people out there suffering, that so many can still sleep soundly while denying the reality of the climate crisis. But another thing that scared me was the ignorance that seems inescapable. Everyone lives their life. We can’t be expected to know everything that is going on in the world. But at the same time, it’s frightening to think about how ignorant I am despite my efforts to the contrary. I had never been fully aware about these devastating fires before this film. And I hadn’t even heard about the wildfires in Australia or the Amazon rainforest until some time after they had begun. There will always be so much that we don’t know. Some part of me can’t help holding the media partially responsible because I don’t think there’s enough coverage about these disastrous events, especially when compared to other far more frivolous matters.
<br><hr>
In the film, "Fire in Paradise" I believe it did an amazing job showing the combination of strong winds and fire.  It showed how easily the fire was being spread throughout with strong gusts of wind.  I thought it was terrifying how fast the fire was moving.  It traveled 7 and a half miles.  The reason for this is climate change.  The film did an exquisite job in educating how climate change affected the wild fires.  Because of droughts and long summers, the grassy areas were dry therefore more permeable to fires.  This combined with the very very strong winds made a terrifying combination.  The winds were able to spread small embers who originally were harmless but with the assistance of the wind it engulfed both sides of the road.  This film does a great job in explaining the dangers of wildfires, and how they are caused.  It all comes back to Climate change in the end.  Because of this issue wild fires are spread and engulf everything in its path burning everything to a crisp.  The wildfires can have deadly and horrible effects and the film does an amazing job capturing that aspect.
<br><hr>
I agree about the films amazing recap about all the events of the fire from beginning to end. Growing up in SoCal, I heard about the Paradise Fire on the news but it never really hit home to me since it was hours away from where I live. When I found out we were watching a film on it I was at first wondering how big of a deal must this fire have been. Little did I know of all the destruction that took place. The recap done in the film really introduced me to the horrors this fire really brought down upon the people. I was very surprised by the end of the film that this amount of tragedy occurred and I was seemingly unaware that the entire town of Paradise was wiped away. It was extremely eye opening that such a major disaster happened in my own state and I didn't know much about it. The film allowed me to feel the pain and sadness of those living there and I can only feel sympathy to what they had to endure.
 <br><br>

With that being said, I noticed a bigger trend to the overall discussion of climate change within the U.S. The film all relates back to the idea that climate change isn't affecting "me" and is something far off. Just like how I didn't know much about the Paradise Fire, I can say with confidence that many across the U.S have not heard of it or think much of it either. This includes our government who's policies still contribute to climate change. These men and women in suits who don't believe climate change is an issue are sitting in a well ventilated, AC room in Washington D.C. Meanwhile, there are firefighters out here risking their lives in hundred degree temps fighting these blazes and saving lives, such as the man in the bulldozer. There are people losing their loved ones, their possessions, and their homes due to these raging fires. Instead of spending the 1.5 million to build new roads to safely evacuate the town, the government most likely would rather spend that money on big business, such as fossil fuels. But then again, some of these politicians don't believe in climate change because "it hasn't affected me yet."
<br><hr>
The documentary “Fire in Paradise” shows us the horrific picturing of the Camp Fire, which was the biggest fire in California’s history and was the most destructive disaster and deadliest wildfire in 2018 as Ken mentioned in the video. Same as you, I cannot imagine how people actually experienced such a terrible disaster. The fire in Australia is the one beyond the feeling of horrible; it’s more like a scary story that will eventually swallow people on Earth. Australia’s remedies seem powerless and they started killing camels. More films like this film should be made and use as alarms for the right here serious consequences.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with this comment 100%. The film did a wonderful job. I got to see the fire and watch what actually went on during that time from a different perspective. It was so saddening and it really pulled at my heartstrings. Crazy to think there are people out there who don't believe climate change is real until it happens to them. It's hard to get people to want to stop climate change but people won't do anything until it happens to them, but at that point it will already be too late. What would you do if something like this were to happen you live? What COULD you do? To see that 85 people died is horrible. To even think about what they were going through, or what their loved ones were going through and are still till this day going through. Climate Change isn't just a short term effect it has on people, it's a long term thing, it will affect and change our lives forever.
<br><hr>
I agree. Watching this film was both mind-blowing and sad. It really expresses fire in a different perspective that it can be so devastating and dangerous that actually cause huge deaths and injuries. The witnesses' feelings are direct and compelling. I always had a feeling that fire is away from me but last year's fire near the school UCSB reminded me that the climate is changing dramatically and fires happen around us.
 <br><br>
Due to the global warming, less moisture is staying in the atmosphere which causes more droughts and fires. The air is having less water molecules and fires are easier to happen. Linking with the recent news of Australian forest fire, the damage it caused like the huge deaths of animals makes me feel deeply blue and powerless of humans' power towards the disaster of nature. Everything happening that links with global warming needs people's more attentions to make changes. The loss during fires can never be accurately calculated and in order to prevent things keep happening in the future, actual changes are needed right now.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said, especially where you mention how the film shows how the fires got out of control before anyone could catch it in its preventable (or at least manageable) stages. One of the more unexpected yet appreciative aspects I get from this film is the reality of the emotions surrounding those affected by the fire. From families to doctors to firefighters to friends, it seems too intense to be true, but theres no denying the effects of climate change when we see houses burning and lives being lost. Its scary to think that only recently we had fires extremely close to Santa Barbara and if they had, knock on wood, an entire community would be lost.
<br><hr>

I agree that wildfire is one of the most serious problems we have which is brought by climate change. As we know the weather of California is dry, which makes California be more easy to have wildfire even if we don't have climate change. But after the climate change, the temperature rises up by two-degree, which makes the air become drier. That leads to an increase in the chance of wildfire. This film gives us a great chance to see how serious the problem can be. And will shock the audience who watch it, which will make people start to have a self-examination and start to do somethings to help the planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you have written. I think the film does an amazing job dictating what was actually going on and in people's heads at the time this event took place. I could not imagine the horror and fear people must have experienced when even the hospital was getting evacuated.  Nurses and doctors had to use their own cars to transport patients away from danger. This is really scary stuff.
 <br><br>

It's even scarier to realize that our lives are going to be more and more like this if people don't change the way we treat the earth. Maybe not specifically fires. But the natural disasters very similar to this that will occur if humans don't take a step back and not overuse the earth is going to be deadly.
<br><hr>

I totally agree with what you have written in your comment. It was depressing watching this film and I got very heartfelt hearing the stories of the people affected by the fires. It is different when you just hear the numbers or data of the event that occurred and when you facing a true story because although you acknowledge the event that happened, it hits different when you see people attached to the story.

<br><hr>
Exactly, It doesnt matter how many films or videos are made. People need to actually belive that they can and have thw ill to make an real impact to help save the climate and environment.
<br><hr>
Agreed, I couldnt image what it would be like to have my enitre community burned to the ground, and come back and nothing would ever be the same.
<br><hr>
I couldn't agree more! Overall, the movie did a spectacular job of displaying how it would actually be in a situation such as the one in "Fire in Paradise." The commentary during the footage was executed well and really portrayed to me the dangers of an actual wildfire. Also, it is pretty unreal that some doctors and nurses helped out by transporting patients with their own automobiles. I feel as if some of the hospital workers would do this but many of them would only care about themselves and just try to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible without even thinking of others. I hope that everyone can get a chance to watch a movie like this where it really brings up the dangers of climate change even in "sunny California."
<br><hr>
I agree with you. Fire is heartbreaking. Fire is warm enough that people get close to it so they can get warmer, but once it gets really close, it hurts, same as the environment. People can enjoy the gift from the nature, but if people get too greedy and take away a lot which they shouldn’t, the nature will hurt them.
 <br><br>

The movie was touching and heart breaking, it shows how small human beings are under the power of nature. It shows how fire can take things or closed people away from people from a second.
 <br><br>

Before a disaster really gets close to you, you could never imagine how painful will that be. Until I watch the film, I didn’t realize the serious cost that human paid for and faced, which more importantly inspires the humans to maintain their own survival.

This video was horrific and made me a little sick even. Finding that people were jumping into lakes because they were literally burning up is horrifying. This reminds me of the same helpless feeling of people in the 911 tragedy and the Triangle shirt factory. I always marvelled at how difficult is seemed to tell how fast a fire spread and in the paradise fire they had no idea given that everyone was busy. It all makes sense though, with trees everywhere, no defensible space anywhere, a lack of exit roads for the population, no town sirens, and a lack of communication led up to a disaster waiting to happen. The citizens couldn’t have known all of this. I attribute all this to PG&E as well as California’s local changing climate and its handling of the Forestry Services in the wake of this issue. Was it also because they can’t afford new machinery due to Clean energy initiatives taking over business and profits? Possibly.

This documentary hit me like a train. I couldn’t stop crying throughout it and had to pause it several times to compose myself. The real time footage captured during the event made everything all the more devastating. I like how there were different perspectives from many interviewees on the entire ordeal; it illustrated how much natural disaster can affect someone’s life from that moment onwards. The extensive progression throughout the film emphasizes how much was lost in the disaster. It was frustrating how the initial response was not rapid; although I understand information can only be spread as fast as conditions allow, it left the population of Paradise in a position of uncertainty. Also, the fact that not every citizen of Paradise had the town wide alert system connected to their devices shows how steady structure in emergency procedures is necessary for the safety of all. The most incriminating is the aftermath and the fire being traced back to the unsafe operations of PG&E. This is a company that provides services to many locations nationwide. Seeing this event unfold from their carelessness and lack of attention to detail worries me more because this is another risk for many acres of land and for the people who live there.

It’s just really sad while watching the whole episode. It’s hard to imagine how a beautiful town would suddenly be burned down in three days. Also,
<br><br>
it’s also really heartbreaking that there’s really nothing people could do to stop the fire. The residents of this town could only stand by and watched this tragedy. Human is still powerless while facing the natural disaster.

This film highlighted the horror and trauma people went through in the 2018 Camp Fire. I remember seeing it on the news and feeling absolutely terrified for the people. It’s crazy that so many of us knew someone or of someone who was affected by the fires. I have a friend in Chico, and she said it was one of the scariest experiences. I have personally never experienced a fire in an extreme situation but when there has been fires back home, the air quality has got really bad, so I can’t even imagine the fear and devastation people felt. It was hard watching the films because you could see as the fires got closer and spread faster. Seeing the cars on fire and houses on fire was so sad because that was someone’s lifelong hard work and dedication. The film puts a face to all the destruction the fires caused



</p><hr>



<p>
It was very difficult watching “Fire in Paradise '', especially knowing many of our friends, neighbors, classmates, etc. were personally affected by it. It was difficult watching the interviewees remembering their experiences, and the thought process and emotions they felt as this was happening before their eyes. Hundreds of people lost their homes, and, unfortunately, many people lost their loved ones. One of the many interviews that really broke my heart was the interview of a resident who remembered telling her husband she was unsure if she could possibly run through the fire as her husband’s response was “you’re going to have to.” The idea of knowing that the person you trust and rely on the most is feeling vulnerable and unable to protect you is unimaginable. My heart breaks for those personally affected by it, and especially those who lost what can never be replaced: family.

I've grown up in an era of worrying about wildfires and Smokey the Bear telling us in commercials "only you can stop wildfires" but by watching this documentary "Fire in Paradise" I can see it's so much more than that. The imagery itself was mortifying and truly heartbreaking as this affected thousands of lives and destroyed a whole community.  PG&E needs to take more accountability and contribute financially to repair the damage inflicted upon this town, but sadly they will continue to deny the issue at hand and continue to have power over providing utilities in different parts of California. The police themselves also failed their people as they should've provided an evacuation alert sooner, like it's legit their job to keep people safe and prevent them from being harmed, yet they failed to do so. Their alert system "Code Red" (maybe) wasn't able to function due to power lines going out and I get that, but addressing the fire sooner as a threat would've meant that folks could get the memo sooner. Families were broken like the girl who lost her mother or the one who lost her grandfather, which is something truly devastating to go through. Also, the structure in place for evacuation was terrible as there was only one road for thousands of people to leave, so basically, that town was never properly embedded with proper means for a safe and efficient evacuation. There's an obvious correlation to anthropogenic climate change that people need to understand as these dangerous fires have been occurring over the past decade and are continuing as there are fires in Australia that are way more detrimental to happening as we speak.

Upon watching this video, I was so horrified at all the destruction that had occurred due to this fire. Many homes and lives were lost and although, it was very interesting to see the recap of the fire and the first hand footage of the disaster itself, it still does nothing but provide a reminder of the tragedy of that day. The fact that 85 people were killed and Paradise was erased just like that was so heartbreaking for me to learn about. In addition, the survival accounts from that day really struck a chord with me because no one should have to go through that devastation. This was a wakeup call for me because it showed just how easily something like this could occur. 
<br><br>
In fact, the Thomas Fire that occurred so close to UCSB and students were trying to take their exams really shows that it could affect anyone at any moments notice. This video also angered me because it was something that could have been preventable but had occurred and quickly became the deadliest wildfire in over a century due to the company's negligence. I could not believe how horrible this was and overall, this video made me extremely sad for the families and their losses. Personally, I cannot imagine losing any of my loved ones and especially to a disaster on this large of a scale is horrifying. The fact that was brought up in this video that of the twenty wildfires in California history, 15 took place in the twenty first century itself is such a sad thing for me to hear because it shows just how much the climate change is exacerbated by the drought conditions that are causing these fires. In addition, the fact that fires in Australia were four times as big as the 15 wildfires in California history combined completely blows my mind and I sympathize with the Australia wildfires that have taken place this year.

The documentary "Fire in Paradise" was a reality check to the say the least. It was very scary to see how easily the Paris community was laid to waste by the destructive fire, in an area not too far from where we are today in Santa Barbara. Already having both the Thomas and Cave fires, it really depicts the fragility of our livelihoods, and how they can be stripped at a moments notice. Watching the film, I deeply wished that it had been fiction. The most frustrating thing is how easily this fire could have and should have been prevented. It was caused by a big corporation who overlooked the detrimental effects its business had on the environment for the sake of financial gain, and because of this not only homes were lost, but lives were too, and with that, a community erased. While individually we can all do our part, a lot rests on the shoulders of these corporations who sully the earth for this capitalist system. 

<br><br>

From a critical standpoint, the documentary did a fantastic job in illustrating not only the destruction caused by the fire itself, but the grave implications of this sad event. It also delivered information regarding climate change that did not feel forced, but was educational through and through.

<p>

"Fire in Paradise" was a great film. I thought the film did a good job presenting the fires as something that is significant. Like I commented in the other video about the "2°C: Beyond the Limit", I was affected by the fires. Hearing from survivors did something to my spirit. I can not imagine thinking losing everything and wondering where home will be. The survivors had no control of the situation. No one ever has control when something like this happens. You feel helpless because you can't prevent it. 

<br><br>

If PG&E did their job, maybe some of those housese would have been saved. Maybe the houses would still be standing. I do think that the workers at PG&E who saw this coming should be investigated.

<p>
After viewing the film “Fire in Paradise“ it is of my opinion that it was quite riddled with intense emotions throughout. The movie was indeed effective in portraying the fires as an extremely important subject matter that needed to be proactive and properly addressed. I have experienced fires here in Santa Barbara, and have for a fact felt in some sort of danger myself. Not directly from the fire but from the air quality and such. It is horrid but also an interesting example in the movie to see that people in paradise do not know they are in danger until the fire is almost upon them, very similar to how the general public in our world chooses to be blind, “ignorance is bliss”. In the film many of the folks in Paradise believed they were not in danger but the truth was that they were.  I found it somewhat difficult to see the survivors speak on their lost loved ones as I could not imagine losing any of my family or close friends to fires. Still there were even some folks who would not leave in some situations because there were no evacuation orders in the area. This is all I am certain because of the intense weather anomalies brought upon by the climate crisis. I hope PG&E is held accountable and faces consequences for ignoring the issue with their tower and thus essentially causing the massive fire.

Fire in heaven" is an incredibly rich film that shows me the damage that can be done when wildfires spread. Although over the past few years, I've heard that fires have threatened California, I've never really understood what's going on. To be frank, fire in heaven is absolutely terrifying. The disconnect between law enforcement and the dire realities of disasters such as fires highlights the idea that mother nature sometimes triumphs over humans, no matter how they plan. Anecdotes of fire survivors add to the gravity of the situation. A few months ago, when I was safely sitting in front of my computer watching this documentary, the interview really brought emotion to my eyes and made me cry during the movie. The documentary is generally well done, showing what happened, why it happened and what could have been different.




<br><br>


One of the interesting points I got from the documentary was that PG&E ignored the situation and if PG&E were alone, they would be imprisoned now. I totally agree with this idea because it seems natural, in a very disturbing way, for a big company to follow the mantra, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." That said, I still think fire in heaven is a well-made film that shows me how climate change is damaging forest fires and how it is empowering them to become annual, thousand-year-old monsters.

<p>
The film "Fire In Paradise" is a compelling and heartbreaking account of the deadly Camp Fire. It weaves together words from firefighters, dispatchers, and victims along with firsthand videos of evacuation and photos of victims. 
<br><br>
My first reaction watching this was sheer helplessness. I come from Tracy, a town in Central Valley that still has lots of farmland and dry vegetation. I imagined how easy it would be for a fire to start and get out of control there. Also, PBS Frontline makes it clear that the systems in place at the time were not enough to handle the stresses placed upon it, and it would have been near impossible to anticipate a fire that spread at 83 football fields a minute, burned 153,000 acres, and was visible from space. The stresses were in part due to climate change. Notice I said "in part."
<br><br>
My second reaction was anger, specifically at Pacific Gas and Electric. This quote from the film sums it up best: "If PG&E was a person, I think they'd be arrested by now." The fact that PG&E 
<br><br>
has violated probation multiple times, combined with the increased costs of mismanaging electric lines in California due to climate change, makes me wish that PG&E actually did go bankrupt instead of being protected by the government and a near monopoly in northern California. 
<br><br>
What I took away from this is that in this day and age, we need to make additional preparations for climate change's effects, regardless of cost or how likely it is to happen. Wildfires have doubled since 1984 across western USA, and other natural disasters are becoming similarly worse.
<br><br>
This was absolutely heartbreaking. I would absolutely recommend it to all my family and friends.

The movie “Fire in Paradise” is so astounding because never before have I seen an entire town taken out in the course of one single fire, caused by a PG&E mishap. Not only is this scary to imagine the terror and these people went through seeing their families, homes, jobs, and any sense of regular life stripped away without any warning or chance for evacuation. Similarly to this student, I also live in the central valley where it is nearly as dry as a desert, with little rainfall each year, but it is also a place of much farmland, where if a fire broke out to this degree, there would be little protecting me from death, and no natural; landscape which could push the fire out of the public harm’s way. 
<br><br>
 I agree with this student’s surprise and horror at the company of Pacific Gas and Electric which was essentially protected by the government and the sheer volume of people which they provide energy to from going bankrupt, since they essentially caused an entire town to be destroyed due to their laziness in tackling problems of electrical lines, created by problems of the climate crisis. Furthermore, its scary that we live in a society in which a major corporation (PG&E) can mismanage their company so badly, and still not have any serious consequences, or dramatically rethink their ways of operation to consider less carbon emissions, in order to stop contributing to a climate crisis which is only making the nature of their business and its dispersal more dangerous.

I thought this documentary was very emotional and deeply worrying. I remember reading about this fire on a news outlet and being terrified despite being so far away. It blew my mind when I got a text from my mom saying that it was smoky outside back home even though Paradise is about 3 hours north from them. I couldn't believe that a fire could take out an entire town in under a day, with many people being unable to escape due to the rapid growth. What really struck me was the images of burned cars on the road, many with their doors open. I can't fathom the amount of fear and bravery these people possessed to have to physically run from the fire because roads were completely packed.
<br><br>


For President Trump to say that it was essentially our fault that this fire happened, just days after the disaster swept through Paradise infuriated me. This explicitly shows what he and too many others believe about climate change: if it isn't directly impacting me then it isn't a problem I should have to worry about, especially those who are rich. It's leaders like these that perpetuate the damage to the planet without regard to the future and hinder our ability to come together as one to change our lifestyles and realize the consequences of our actions.

After watching the movie “Fire in Paradas“, I think it was an emotionally heavy movie. I experienced a wildfire in Santa Barbara late last year. However, I never felt that I was in imminent danger. I know I'm safe. The terrible truth to see in the fire of heaven is that people in heaven do not know they are in danger until the fire is almost upon them. Many of them believed they were safe, and it was hard to see those who survived to describe their efforts to help their loved ones. Relatives who refused to leave in some cases because there were no evacuation orders in the area. It is sad to think that this fire might have been less serious if climate change had not been so aggressive. I believe PG&E will surely face consequences for ignoring their tower and causing a fire. And, those who responded to the fire should have warned those in heaven earlier and used better systems to do so. But the most pernicious aspect of fires is that they spread so quickly and fiercely, thanks to drought and high winds brought on by climate change. The fire in heaven is just one example of how natural disasters have become more visible and dangerous, and we need to plan for bigger events and try to stop climate change from intensifying.

I agree with you. When I saw the little girl crying for the death of her father, I couldn’t help myself crying too. On one side, this fire in Paradise was an accident caused by a falling of a component; on the other side, this fire, especially the harm done by it, was caused by multifaceted factors. Climate change has caused the temperature of California to rise a lot. The biggest four fires happened in California happened in the last four years, and they are growing continually. The rising temperature has caused increasing droughts, killing plants and animals, and the coastline is climbing up to the beach, destroying houses and facilities near the coast. Also, it’s hard for the fire department to evacuate people in Paradise too. Since there are not enough firemen in the county and the fire is spreading fast, many people didn’t know about the fire and the severity of it, and they died for this. What’s more, the company which was supposed to be responsible for it, PG&E, didn’t value the importance of the quality of their products. With such huge equipment in the mountains, they should do inspections more frequently to make sure everything is ok, especially that they have already been warned before. I think people in the USA should really focus more on the impacts of climate change on California and take immediate actions, especially the government.

The film "Fire in Paradise" makes me really think about climate change. Being born and raised in California, it's sometimes hard to see what climate change is going on. This film encapsulates what type of climate change is going on. With less humidity in the air, windy seasons and long time periods without water. All of these have a direct impact on fires that start. To see this much disaster happen in real life in my home state frightens me. We must stay more aware and proactive.

Though from Ken's trigger warning I knew what kind of stuff I was getting into when putting on the film, I was absolutely shocked after watching the events of the film conspire. The way the directors of this documentary chose to not hide from the horrifying parts of the fire in Paradise definitely helped sell its message and invoked some type of fear of fire within me. It's so sad to see how the people of Paradise have been impacted since. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose my home, much less lose my entire hometown, and perhaps even some people that I knew or some friends from school. Because I've never experienced a real fire, it's hard for me to imagine what it must be like to be faced with a real one, but after seeing this film, I know that it's something I can't even begin to fathom.
<br><br>


Wildfires, and other natural disasters, are going to only worsen as we continue to neglect our planet. This horrible fire that destroyed this town is going to come back even bigger to destroy even more towns, and it's as if Mother Earth is responding back to our mistreatment of her, and hitting us back.

The film records a unprecedented fire in a small town “Paradise”. The paradise became hell when fire was coming. What was so astounding was that the burned area is equivalent to Chicago. And everybody had not imagined that the fire would be so severe. The mom did not gain information about the fire immediately. So she did not leave with her daughter. She just thought that the fire will not cause danger to Paradise. In the end, she died in her home. For another example, the girl’s grandfather was left in the his home, he also died because of the fire. Although they were counted for the number of who died from the fire, the death of them caused the sadness of their whole family. The main reason of the fire may be the aging wire, but climate change also contribute to the result of fire. The increasing temperature make the fire more easily happen. We just through this film know one of different catastrophes caused by climate change. Flooding, war, food shortage and so on, are the results of climate change. Because of them, people lose their home, government spend more money to construct new facilities, even many people lose their life. We must to think about how to decrease the global warming. Climate change is happening!

The documentary is full sense of reality, including the interplay and replay of the original pictures (fire records), and the follow-up interviews with firefighters, residents of the town and the police. The 40minute documentary once again recreates to the audience the tragic scene of the fire, and makes people witness the deterrent power of the nature with their own eyes. People from not caring about it to treat it seriously (hoping we can rely on manpower to solve the mountain fire), to helpless (in the face of nature's harsh challenges, people have no other choice but to accept), praying for god's blessing, and finally have to admit the human insignificance and vulnerability. From this work, the audience can clearly see that many people (even the fire alarm center) of the fire hazard of the forecast is not enough. Therefore, for human beings, any natural disaster should not to be underestimated, we must seriously face, deal with. After all kinds of natural disasters, how should people start a new life?
<br><br>
Indeed, it is very difficult to start it all over again. Besides rebuilding the houses, another thing we really need to do is to realize that this natural disaster is caused by human. Global warming caused the increase of temperature so that increase the possibility of mountain fire. So what we need to do is to realize global warming’s power and stop it.

Its crazy to think such an event can occur and  you would have never thought that it would happen in your own lifetime. A place where not many people know that is located in Northern California, Paradise. Has even literally burned to the ground due to these recent wildfires that were almost impossible to contain. Having the citizens of the poor city in ruin and their dignity literally being burned from them. My great aunt lives up there. My family and I would visit nearly every summer or whenever we got the chance. She had lived in a beautiful house with tulips surrounding the landscape. Also covered by trees in which resembled a forest and made the scenery more Devine. A place which seemed like an actual paradise. Unfortunately, this house full with memories of laughter and pure enjoyment is sitting there in its own ash and its like nothing was ever there in the first place. What was once a beautiful paradise is now a wasteland.  Pictures destroyed, memories lost forever due to climate change and a simple fire that went to ruin. To think many dont bother with it only because it didn't happen to them. I know it wasn't my house that burned down but It sure felt like it with all my childhood memories gone overnight.

This movie had a truly chilling and long-lasting effect on me. I feel that I have seen the devastation of fires throughout my life. I have friends whose homes have burnt down within the last year and one of my high school prom date's school actually burnt down. But I have never experienced the terror of what fire can do first hand. This movie shared a perspective with me that has not only alarmed me to the vicious effects of climate change, but made me more empathetic to those I know and don't know who have been effected by wildfires. This is why this movie is so impactful. It perfectly blends both the causes and effects of climate change on wildfires with how it changes the lives of the people in fire zones. I feel like one of the main reasons humans have so much trouble making a significant change in their environmental practices is that they don't directly see the effects of their actions. Climate change is a interconnected but long term process that is not directly seen by everyone. However, these fires are clear and impactful evidence of what is happening to the planet. And while what they leave behind physically is horrible, it does motivate those finally seeing the effects to try to make a change in their actions.

The documentary, "Fire in Paradise" was a very emotional and heart-wrenching film to watch. If this isn't something that can alert the government or the high politicians to act now, then I truly don't know what will. Me being a California resident, I have seen some pretty gruesome fires that have plagued through California, but this film truly captivates the dangers and destruction of malice of fires, and shows first-hand victims an dhow they were affected. The damage that came from this fire, isn't just a number, or another statistic, it's a message to us as inhabitants of this planet, a cry for help, and a cry for action. The fire isn't just something to be taken as just another occurrence, it has ended the lives of peaceful people, it has ruined the place, thousands of people once called home. Its disgusting, how the unwillingness of the those above us has placed in a state of not only negligence, but just the idea of us making this a "regular occurrence", how we have came to terms with our destiny, because the greed and money that runs through politics and monopolies is what truly runs the world. We, as inhabitants, are nobody to decide what is best for the planet, or pick and choose what to do, as if it were our home. We must act now... because it is our only home. Fire in Paradise perfectly captivates this pain of the people, the catastrophic entropies of fire in nature, and much more. This truly brings up the question , to even the most uneducated person, with a sliver of common sense, what could we have done to avoid this? What could we have done to avoid the deaths of many people, the loss of thousands of homes, and the loss of our confidence in a brighter future. 
<br><br>

The film effectively conveys its message to the viewer, and is open for all to watch. It grabs the viewer by the strings of their heart, and truly shows them why we must change. It shows us how even when we think, "oh it can't get any worse than this" it just exponentially grows, taking everything in its path. "Fire in Paradise" is a very emotional film and what truly got to me was the constant confusion and worry and inability to truly process what was going on. The sense of hopelessness throughout the film really brings the viewer to tears. They fought endlessly without knowing what was truly helping or what they could even effectively do, and that in the end is what got me. The evacuation of the hospital was a staple traumatic scene in the film, because it shows the dire necessity of aid, slowly being tarnished by the roaring flames. Confusion and helplessness filling the hearts and minds of thousands. But, this film is why we need to change our ways, do whatever it takes. We cannot allow this to become commonplace. We must fight for our Earth, so that no more lives and homes are dreadfully lost, to a cause we can avoid so simply.

This documentary definitely hit hard for me, since I was born and grew up on the central coast of California which makes all of this is stuff that has happened right in my backyard.  It was also a truly heart-wrenching film to watch since it did exactly what Ken said; put a face to the climate crisis.  The first-hand accounts from survivors and the use of videos from the actual event were both very powerful and moving, and really showed how quickly things can become deadly.  I didn't know that it was even possible for a fire to travel an entire acre in a matter of minutes, yet most of the accounts said that they went from not seeing anything to being completely surrounded by flames in just minutes.  I found myself feeling numb during the videos from the hospital when they were trying to evacuate all the patients.  It was honestly insane watching in real-time how close and quickly the fire moved in, and how there were still people trying to be evacuated when there were embers flying past.  The video from the woman who was stuck in her car on the road and had fire surrounding seemed like something out of a horror movie, and I honestly couldn't believe that she had to run through the fire in order to survive.  I feel like you only hear horror stories of things like that happening, yet seeing the firsthand accounts and listening to the survivors tell their story makes it seem all too real.  

<br><br>

I think that each year these periods of prolonged droughts are only going to get worse, as are the winds and temperatures.  It makes me scared for this year since every year for the past three years there has been a fire that has been increasingly larger and dealt more damage and destruction than the one prior.  It is obvious that the climate crisis is already upon us, and future weather catastrophes are only going to get worse.

Human beings are always arrogant clamoring to change the world and the environment, but they don't know that in the face of mighty nature, they are just as little as dust, and the so-called civilization, is nothing but the instant flying ashes and smoldering smoke. This is a real documentary, which not only includes the interleaving and replaying of the original fire scene  but also the subsequent recording of interviews with firefighters, town residents and police. In the space of 40 minutes, this documentary once again reappeared the tragic scene of the fire to the audience, and let people witness the deterrent force of nature. From indifferent, to serious (hoped to rely on human resources to solve the mountain fire), people finally had to admit their smallness and fragility and escaped. 
<br><br>

I was absolutely astounded and completely engrossed the entire time when I was watching the film, in which I saw that many people even the fire alarm center are not enough to predict the harm of the fire. For us, any natural disaster should not be underestimated and must be seriously faced and dealt with. The film does a great job at touching and affecting the viewer in an emotional way. I am glad the film did this because it is an effective way to really implement this into peoples minds



</p><hr>



<p>
I literally cried for the people who experienced the fire. I was never in any of the danger but I've always wanted to have a try although I might get hurt. I have always wanted to dig my deepest instinct in front of disasters. I was hoping to see how brave I can be and how generous is me myself. But the documentary really showed me a true disaster and people's reactions to it. I was moved by the saying "I thought I almost lost you." I was awed by that gentle giant. I was mutual to the firechief's helplessness. I was convinced that I should do something to stop the following possible catastrophe, at least some help.

Watching this film is a heartbreaking process. It’s a a true-to-life documentary, interspersed with replays of the original footage, as well as followed by recordings of interviews with firefighters, townsfolk and police. In the short 40-minute documentary, it reveals the tragic scene of fire to audience once again, so that people witnessed the deterrent force of nature once again. The film gives a good description of different stage of people's attitudes towards fire: from indifference and absent-mindedness, to seriousness, to powerlessness, to ask for God's blessing, and finally to acknowledge the smallness and fragility of human beings. In addition to this, the film addresses some questions to audiences as well:
<br><br>
First of all, how should people face nature disasters? In the film, the audience can clearly see that many people’s (even the fire alarm center) attitudes towards fire is perfunctory, and they pay the piper in the end. Therefore, for human beings, we can’t underestimate any natural disaster, we must deal with them seriously.
<br><br>
Secondly, how can people help themselves facing nature disasters? The film gives out two answers. People should contact the relevant departments to carry out timely rescue first. If this option is not successfully implemented, it is necessary to assess the situation, quickly find an alternative. If there is no choice, people must quickly evacuate the disaster site. 
<br><br>
Thirdly, how should people adjust they mentality after experiencing nature disasters? In the face of sudden natural disasters, any change in mentality is normal. Some, sit and wait; some, flee; some, kneel and pray... All of this behavior is in the "normal category". But the question is, what happens next. Is it a step forward or a step back? Give up hope or fight?  That's important, because, at this moment, "a change of heart" may affect a person's future. In the film, the rescue workers, trapped people in unison gave the "positive face”,  which was the heart of the most authentic voice at that moment.
<br><br>
Last but not least, how should people start new life after nature disasters? Honestly, it’s really hard to start over, especially psychologically repair. Only time still has a chance to smooth over the hearts of people's wounds.

Many aspects of this film were--quite frankly--terrifying. I think it’s really easy to hear about disasters coming from climate change and consider it very objectively; many of us can feel a big detachment from these issues, because we’re not right in the middle of the problem. However, this film quite literally puts you in the middle of it. This is a fire that would not have happened under normal conditions, and it was the most expensive disaster of 2019 in the world. It’s almost hard to believe that something like this can happen and be dismissed as something that’s not a result of climate change. It’s even harder to believe that the leader of our country would threaten to cut funding in this growing problem because it’s a result of “poor forest management,” and we just need to “clean” our forest floors. And it’s not just fires. Fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, mudslides: so many disasters are happening more and more, and they’re getting worse and worse. Last month, there was a tornado warning in Santa Barbara. In Santa Barbara. We’re living in a time that is literally apocalyptic, and yet there are still deniers and people that don’t want to act.

Just like your comment, it’s just so sad how many lives the Paradise fire affected. What’s even sadder to me is how Pg&E is barely made accountable even with all 30,000 acres its’ mistakes ruined and the 85 lives lost because of their mistake. This film was so impactful to me because we were actually able to see how lives were ruined and tearful recounts of peoples’ experiences with the fire. Those stories really hit hard, knowing that the same thing could happen to any of us any time. Living in California is quite scary now, knowing how common fires are and how we have the perfect conditions for them to spread and destory everything so quickly, as we have seen in the past couple of years. I find it amazing that even with the frequency of fires and other climate motivated disasters that some people still do not believe in climate change. That just makes me wonder, how much further does it have to go to make climate change deniers believe in the reality of the Climate Crisis.

As Ken mentions, the Paradise Fire documentary places a human face on the climate crisis, and it demonstrates that the climate crisis is here in the U.S. It’s not so distant or unimaginable as many have throught, and many still do. Having lived through the chaos and fear of the Thomas fire during my second year here at UCSB, I am constantly reminded of how fortunate I am. Watching this documentary reminded me of the confusion and worry my roommate and I felt as we received evacuation alerts nights before finals. This same worrisome feeling came back just a couple of weeks ago when the Cave fire broke out and we could clearly see it from our bedroom window. The truth is climate change is here, in Santa Barbara, in Ventura, in Paradise, all across California and this documentary does an incredible job at putting a human face on climate change. It illustrates how devastating wildfires are, not only in the sense that they destroy land, but also people’s entire lives are jeopardized. Watching this documentary was incredibly emotional and heartbreaking. The rate at which the fire grew and moved was so devastating to see and it shows that no level of preparedness or precaution is sufficient to combat the chaos of climate change disasters. The clips of the town on fire looked like scenes from an apocalypse movie or something out of a sci-fi film. Although the fire began very early in the morning and continued for weeks, it looked as if it was night time. It was scary to see how this fire impacted the community of Paradise. The 911 calls, and the testimonials from dispatchers, firefighters, and civilians were so agonizing to listen to.

After watching “Fire in  Paradise '' I was shocked that the news of this fire was not more prevalent throughout the media outlets. The beginning of the film was basically a representation of how most of the world views the climate crisis. They believe it's not a big deal such as the firemen thought the fire was not as big a deal as they thought it would be since they happen often. This shows how significant impacts are beginning to be seen as day to day occurrences. As the film progressed I was extremely saddened by the story of the little girl's grandfather who perished in the fires. What was even more heartbreaking was the story one of the 911 callers had where people stuck  in a house couldn't get out trying to get help and had to be hung up on because they couldn't be understood anymore and they had to go to the next call. I thought about the anxiety  and hopelessness these people must be feeling. Fires are a direct impact to everyone in California and nothing compared to what the people of Paradise went through when Santa Barbra had cave fires at the end of fall quarters. I was a little worried that we were not being evacuated as fires can spread quickly with wind. Ths was the case when Paradise burned down in a span of four hours. The climate crisis is causing fires to occur 2 times more often and due to drought and dry land the consequences are also much harsher. 
<br><br>

Sad but true the issues that arise from climate change must be taken much more seriously and not left to the people to suffer alone. One of the officers said that the best escape plan to be made for each individual was by the individual himself. This was a weird comment for me because I felt as if they were looking to blame the public for not being prepared, which is preposterous. As firemen and part of the community themselves plans should be made beforehand so the public can feel assured and ready for action when fires occur. With such plans in place there would not be people stuck on roads suffocation as the film showed.

I'll admit that before watching this film I had a very vague idea of what wildfires where like, after all I did watch bambi a long time ago, but in comparison to "Fire in Paradise" I now realize that I have been grossly underestimating the destructive power of wildfires. Mother nature is scary. It is even scarier to think that because of climate change, we will soon see more and more severe natural disasters. Can we even call it a natural disaster at this point. After having learned how much impact we have on the environment of our planet, I think someone could very reasonably argue that severe weather is no longer purely natural. What is thought of as a phenomenon loses its abnormality when it occurs so frequently. "Of the 20 largest wildfires in California history, fifteen took place in the twenty first century" (Hiltner). We have only been in the 21st century for 2 decades. That puts things in a very blunt perspective. I used to hear the fact and figures like "we have 12 years to fight climate change before it's too late" and I would think "12 years? That's ridiculous" but it really isn't. If 15 out of the 20 most devastating wildfires in California happened in the last two decades, then either we birthed a record number of arsonist or we are headed in the direction of a catastrophic climate crisis. My money is on the latter.

Fire in Paradise introduces how climate change will bring about many different consequences rather than just sea level rise. This film also addresses how quickly a fire can get out of control. Yes a mixed of emotions do come about, many people frustrated at the what if or what if we did that, ultimately just wasting time and the fire only getting more out of control than it actually is. But who’s to say the different solutions that could’ve been done, we aren’t fire Marshalls, unless you have experienced something so dire like this first hand, it’s hard to really comment something like that. It’s hard to put myself in the victim’s shoes because I have never gone through something so impactful to someone’s life. It's a life or death situation that many people can’t say they’ve gone through. This documentary is a reminder that climate change is indeed here, and it is a serious issue that we need to combat. If action isn’t taken now then the effects of climate change are just going to get worse and worse

This film was another great watch, but especially for its incredible personal factors. Again, how real everything is, is probably the biggest factor as to why documentaries like this are such an important thing to watch and spread. The town of Paradise isn’t where we are from, but this is just Northern California. It still blows my mind that the Thomas Fire, which was surpassed by the Ranch Fire, which was again surpassed within the same year by this fire, the Camp Fire (in terms of destruction). It only displays one specific zoned in case, yet it speaks leaps on what has been the consequences of our actions that have clearly influenced the severity of issues such as this. The sheer panic and chaos that was displayed in this documentary brought a closer sense of terror as I quickly was able to apply the images here to what many of our UCSB peers may have had to experience just a few years back. Professor Hiltner mentions that unlike all our other films that really focus on addressing climate change as a whole and seek to educate, this film takes a different approach with a different effect, yet equally is able to show the severity of the consequences to global warming and how it has been impacting the lives of those around us.
<br><br>

As someone who has grown up in California my whole life, it is not uncommon that there has been wildfire occurrences here, however, it wasn’t something prevalent and serious in my eyes as I was never part of one in person. The stories of the Thomas Fire after coming to UCSB has always been something that seems unreal to me as I was only less than a year late to miss this occurrence before I started my freshman year, but for others, this is reality. These fires are getting bigger every year, raising the bar to how life-threatening our situations truly are. It is frustrating to see these things erupt in large events across the world. The Amazon fire, Australian fire, and so many others that go unreported widley and are much more local. This reminds me of a few months ago when the fire erupted near UCSB along the mountains. I was at the library at the time on the 8th floor, and looked out to see a whole section out there in flames. The lights in the building kept flickering. I remember that even that was enough to shake my insides, in worry that the fire would spread out further and reach us on campus.
<br><br>

While some fires are natural and part of life, there are definitely more fires these days than our surroundings should be receiving. The nature of these fires and origins come about differently as well. The drought issue is something that almost all Californians know about if they have lived here within the last decade, and as such, this has pushed the threat of wildfires before our eyes. The first hand experience displayed in this film really draws its audience into the experiences of those directly affected by wildfires. By making climate change something so personally addressed is an incredibly powerful strategy to bring in emotions to the film, as well as push the urgency of it all. Climate change is affecting the world heavily and we live within a time period where it has shown its terror to be feared by all of us in any part of the world. Professor Hiltner’s personal experience he shares as well with the Thomas Fire gave me another perspective to put myself into, as he worried for his daughter, and like he said, worried about not having a home to return to. This is truly what some people in high risk zones are thinking about often, and I can’t imagine how terrifying this thought is, that at any moment, all your things, your shelter, could be gone and eaten into flames.



</p><hr>



<p>

I can’t imagine the panic and fear that the people from Paradise felt as their city was burning down. What surprised me the most was just how dark their skies were at 9:30am. These people feared their lives and some unfortunately did lose their lives. The people in this city and in every fire-prone city that has had to live their life ready evacuate can no longer be prepared for the fires that are bound to come. The narrator shared that 10/20 of the most destructive fires in the nation have happened in the past 4 years. The consequences of climate change are here and they’re coming at us head strong. We have tested the limits of Mother Earth and now she doesn’t have any remorse. To know that people are losing their homes and their lives due to these “natural” disasters is heartbreaking and it’s even more heartbreaking to know that there’s more to come, more fires, stronger winds, longer droughts, and severe floods.

The documentary, “Fire in Paradise,” was hard for me to watch. I remember when this fire occurred, however I only ever heard of it a handful of times on the news and I did not know too much about it. Although I knew it was a deadly and harsh event, this film made me realize how massive it really was. It showed us the disastrous results of Camp Fire. Listening to what some of the residents of Paradise had to experience during that devastating event makes it even more saddening to watch. Overall, this documentary really put the devastating outcomes of this immense fire in perspective for me.



</p><hr>



<p>
Fire in Paradise shows the audience directly the damages brought to the community by the Camp Fire. It starts small and far away from the neighborhoods, and people in California has already gotten used to the wildfires since it’s so dry and hot. But unfortunately, the fire soon spread out and became the worst wildfires in California that burnt down billions of dollars of houses and some people lost their lives in the fire. The documentary focuses on the ongoing recovery process in the community that is affected by the fire and follows up with the influence it brought. There are a lot of real footage and interviews of the survivors in the film, and it is heartbreaking to see what the fire has done to them. 
<br><br>

We also experienced the wildfire last year that it spread very quickly and we could see the fire clearly even in the dorms. I still remember how nervous and terrified I was to see such a big fire that I had no idea whether it is going to affect us or not. I would like to improve our environment to decrease the chances of having wildfires. We need to save water and protect the environment, so the soil can be moisturized.

<p>
After finishing the documentary "Fire in Paradise", I was utterly appalled.  My heart was torn when the film showed the just how devastating the fires were.  I thoroughly enjoyed at how the film was able to seamlessly connect irresponsible human behavior with these fires, acting as a wake up call for those who haven't made the connection of them yet.  I previously already had an idea of this, but the film made it much more clearer at how climate change helped increase how devastating a fire could get. My condolences to the families who lost loved ones in the fire.

<br><br>

Also, the film perfectly encapsulated at how we ourselves are responsible for the environment. The PG&E company were utterly irresponsible for safety, and as someone previously stated, they were "literally and figuratively playing with fire". This should be taken as a future precaution. A quote that I would say could describe the vibe that the film gave off for me was "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." The fire was easily preventable, and we should keep a closer eye on companies that may impact the environment in any way.

I had to shake myself out of the speechlessness I felt after watching Fire in Paradise to begin writing this comment. The most horrific moment of the documentary for me, although there were many, was of the 911 operator who described how he had no choice but to stay on the line as people trapped in their homes suffered and presumably died, and all he could do was move on to the next call, one after the next. 
<br><br>
I think that sometimes I can become numb to the more personal consequences of climate change. I know the facts; I know the statistics about sea level rise and the number of climate migrants per year and the list of possible weather phenomena as well as the likely economic, social and cultural impacts of climate change, but often I turn off the part of my brain capable of thinking about and empathizing with the unique human beings whose lives have already been destroyed or lost because of climate change, because doing so on a daily basis while sitting in my Environmental Studies courses is simply too emotionally draining. However, this documentary forced me to face that horror head-on, and doing so every once in a while is important to keep my priorities in the right place. The climate crisis is a life or death situation for almost everyone on the planet. Every year of inaction is another year that catastrophes such as the Camp Fire become even more likely. This documentary may not have primarily focused on the climate crisis, but it nevertheless reminded me why I am a climate crisis activist.

I completely agree with you. There maybe some man-made mistakes, but the effect of camp fire is still too horrible for us to  even think about. This reminds me of the fire took place in Goleta last quarter. We will maybe face these kinds of circumstances if we climate activist di not act to protect our homes.

After watching the documentary, i realized that i used to underestimated the power of wildfire and the seriousness of the damage caused by wildfire.  This documentary told me how real or how close the wildfire is to me, as a student in california, and how urgent the wildfire is through showing the real videos, images, talks and recalling the whole process of the fire.
<br><br>
The documentary talked about different aspect of the fire. I actually noticed the irresponsibility of some relevant institutions like PG&E and the cal fire police the most. Those institutions took their responsibility of causing the wildfire happened, spread and being worse. The American largest electronic company, PG&E, didn’t maintained their facilities well. After fire happened, they even didn’t take action immediately. And the Cal Fire might not pay much attention the that fire or the Cal Fire underestimated the spread of the wildfire. So, the Cal Fire didn’t prevent more spread at once and they didn’t warn people of the danger, they even spread error message. No one receive the warning message or official evacuation order. All of these caused a larger spread of fire and more damage. When i saw the image that people try to drive out of the fire and the fire spread so fast to both side of the road, i can feel how despair those people were especially when i saw the part of the woman recalling her experience of driving through fire. This documentary really show how serious damage the fire can cause on people, it’s heartache when i saw people getting scared of dying from fire and loosing family from the fire.

The Fire in Paradise documentary completely shook me. I felt as if I was watching a thriller, cringing on the edge of my seat in debilitating fear. I had no idea that the Paradise Fire was so devastating because people were so ill-informed and therefore unprepared. The firefighters in the film kept mentioning how it looked manageable and they didn’t take it too seriously because fires happen a lot in that area, yet it is now known as the deadliest fire in California’s history. The film really provides an in depth, human-take on the impacts of the climate crisis through people’s personal experiences. 
<br><br>

I just kept thinking, what would I do if I saw a fire coming toward me, yet was repeatedly told not to worry and that I wasn’t in any immediate danger. Then I realized, THAT’S WHAT’S HAPPENING! 
<br><br>

The Paradise Fire is a smaller, although extremely catastrophic metaphor for the larger impending climate crisis. Our governments are playing the role of CalFire, assuring us that the danger is still far away, but it’s not! It’s right here, staring us in the face. So what do we do? At what point do you take it upon yourself to take action?

I became terrified for the future as I watched the documentary “Fire in Paradise.” I can briefly recall hearing about this specific fire, but I did not know the full details of it. Before watching this documentary, I did not know the deadly impact that it had on people in that area. I grew up in Sacramento and it is so heartbreaking to me to know that this devastation occurred less than two hours away. It also enraged me that this occurred because of the recklessness of not only PG&E as they failed to prevent their towers from malfunctioning, but also us human beings. Although the documentary did not focus on climate change, I fully believe that climate change did play a huge role in the fire that caused destruction in Paradise. 
<br><br>

Most of the people living in Paradise did not expect the fire and thought November 8, 2018 was just another normal day. Instead, they had to experience what it is like to literally be engulfed in fire. Not only did this fire burn their homes and personal possessions, but also prematurely took the lives of their loved ones. I honestly cannot comprehend the tragedy that the people in Paradise had to go through.

While watching the documentary “Fire in Paradise”, I couldn’t help but feel sadness and disappointment. While it was heart wrenching, it was an extremely informative and much needed documentary that gives a great insight into how uncontrollable these fires are becoming. “Fire in Paradise'' also helps show the severity these fires have in communities and the long lasting impacts members of the communities are left to deal with even after the fire. Getting to see actual footage of what the fire looked like was terrifying even more so trying to imagine what those individuals had to endure with. I think one of the most heartbreaking scenes is when a teacher says another teacher and herself “prayed we would die of smoke inhalation”, while they had to stay strong and care for the kids that were on the bus. Getting to hear the stories of community members is what makes this documentary so saddening yet important. It angered me to see how hopeless and scared community members felt. It angered me when the emergency dispatchers responses to community members in a very dismissive way, while I understand they had hundreds of calls to get too, these people were scared and deserved to have gotten warnings ahead of time to have had more time to prepare to evacuate. The part of the film where a firefighter talks about how weather is affecting these fires is important and helps tie everything mentioned in the documentary together. The fact new records are set with fires annually is saddening. I still can’t believe all that was lost and all they are still having to deal with.

While watching "Fire in Paradise," it was heartbreaking to see how some of the fire's damage could have been prevented if things had either been communicated more effectively or conditions had been right. In the beginning of the film, one of the firefighters mentions that when the fire first started and was found it could have have been extinguished. Due to steepness of the area, a firetruck wasn't able to safely reach the area and air support couldn't be dispatched due to the winds. I could only imagine how disheartening it must have felt to look at the fire and realize you can't effectively put it out due to limitations. Another part of the film that made me feel  helpless as a viewer was seeing the 911 dispatchers tell residents that they were safe because CalFire hadn't executed an evacuation. No one predicted that the fire could cross the canyon, but it did. I think this made me realize that climate change events tend to have even more catastrophic results sometimes because people don't realize the extent these events can reach. It makes people think that events like this are impossible and won't happen when in reality everything is possible now. As a California resident, fires become a common event that you get used to hearing about on the news; however, this film effectively made me realize that every fire isn't just another fire. Even if the fire isn't directly affecting me as a person, it's affecting someone somewhere else. 
<br><br>

The Australian fire is an example of how because the fire is somewhere else we don't tend to care about it as much. Most people will think about the fire for the first few days or week, but a couple days later they will tend to forget about it even though people continue to suffer. It's easy to forget when the situation isn't happening close to you and the media stops reporting on it. This is why I feel its so hard to make climate change deniers realize climate change is real. Most of these deniers have not experienced these catastrophic events themselves or seen them at close proximity that it's easy for them to deny it.

The documentary film fire in paradise puts a human face to the global climate crisis. The documentary details a heart wrenching narrative that shows the very quintessential American town being ravaged by fire and potentially also thr influence of corporate greed. The effects from climate change Are irrefutable and basically out of the question, but the most troubling part was all of the human error that could have so easily been mended. Aside from the selfishness that led to the global climate changes, the city of Paris was directly affected by electric companies neglecting the safety systems on highly volatile machinery. The most profound but also noticeable consequence of irresponsible energy use over the past few decades and leading more into the 21st century, is the widespread human suffering.

The fire was started by PG&E’s 100-year-old electric wire, and the condition is so dry that the fire can spread without any obstacles in the so-called “Paradise”. Even though the condition is extremely ideal for the spread of fire, there is no doubt that the major consequence should come to the corporation PG&E, which provides electricity to most people around the nation. They didn’t stop the electricity with an excuse that the wind is decreasing in speed. The starting fireplace is too narrow for firemen to enter and the wind is too big for air spray. However, at this certain point, I am a bit sorry for the loss. How could a fire station have no access to forest fire and can only stand there and watch it spread? I don’t think large wind and remote fire is uncommon in California, the Paradise. So firemen just stood there and watched them burn? I did not require them to be like Chinese firemen who were willing to sacrifice themselves to put out the fire, but equipment that could put out the fire under such circumstances should be adopted to control the fire in the smallest scale, before it teared down thousands of houses and dove thousands of people away from their houses. After the fire broke out, the fire agency did take great responsibility. The neglect of this fire as a major fire first stopped the agency from paying sufficient attention, and then when the chief finally realized the fire’s severity, they had firemen trapped and thus cannot get up-to-date information about the fire. Forgive me for being critical to those guys who stand on the first-line fighting with fire. However, I do think that California needed a more sophisticated agency of wildfire considering the frequency fires broke out here.

As a fellow Californian who has been affected by both the Paradise disaster and the overall recent shift towards annual wildfires, this film personally felt more powerful than some of the other materials/events covered so far in the course. Although melting ice caps in the Arctic is quite important in terms of the climate crisis, there's something about reliving these fires that have hit closer to home (most likely because it has affected both my and friends' and families' lives). 
<br><br>

Even though climate change played a major role in the severity of the Camp Fire (along with many of the other fires Northern California), I can't go without saying that I am deeply disgusted with PG&E and their negligence in relation to these fires. It's almost unimaginable to think that they can get away with denial over any wrongdoing in their practices in the 20 or so years leading up to these events. While CEOs and other high-level executives Tony Earley Jr. and Geisha Williams made millions of dollars per year each, they failed and still TO THIS DAY fail to use civilian and state funds to 1)maintain volatile electrical equipment, 2)groom vegetation effectively, and 3)provide proper responses to developing disasters. Now that they have finally begun to see repercussions for their complete disregard for the people they cover in California, it's still infuriating to see that the new CEO Bill Johnson will make at least $6 million dollars through his salary and coexisting benefits, all while the public has to suffer through power shutoffs "as a means of prevention" instead of properly maintaining/restoring failing equipment (which in the long term would be a much more profitable and effective prevention measure). These recent power shutoffs back home in the Bay Area didn't even make that much of a difference, with major fires still starting in the dead zones!
<br><br>

How much will it take for PG&E and other big companies to finally overcome their greed and realize the consequences of their actions?

The PBS documentary "Fire in Paradise" is terrifying and emotional. It follows a order of time to give a clear view of how Camp Fire, deadliest wildfire in Californian history by far ( I have to say by far because how more intense and severe wildfires become each year) have impacted the town of Paradise. In the film, it shows how wildfire builds up from a small fire which can be easily contained to a large one that went out of control. Such building of fire reveals lacking of effective ways to contain large fires and efforts by governments and corporations. Actual footage at the front line in Paradise really persuades the severeness of fire and eager from people to live. 
<br><br>


The film successfully convinced audiences how climate change impact all people's lives. Prolonged drought and summer creates a potential wildfire and just as film said "all it need just a match, and it brings a catastrophe." It shows that climate change does more than raising sea-level that would have drown European countries and East Asia. American people should aware that you are not different from people in other parts of the world when climate crisis come. As Ken said, even though people are lucky enough to live after the fire, the impact on natural world will punish human one way or another. 

<br><br>

Lastly, I am shocked and speechless when the fact that Australian fire is 4-times greater than the deadliest 15 Californian wildfires combined. I have friends right now in Sydney and Melbourne and hoping they are safe and more importantly all lives in Australia to be safe.

I was absolutely astounded and completely engrossed the entire time I was watching the film "Fire in Paradise". Obviously, being a resident of California, I've been exposed to the destruction that California's wildfires have wreaked on communities in the past few years, so I'm never completely shocked hearing about a new wildfire happening in areas prone to being bone-dry and susceptible to intense winds. However, as I was watching this film, I was shocked by how intense this fire was in particular, and how many mistakes were made that accumulated into the total devastation that occurred in Paradise. 
<br><br>

Even with the intense preparation that the community of Paradise had taken to combat a wildfire should the situation arise, the intensity of this particular fire exceeded any preconceived ideas on what a wildfire could amount to. Emergency responders simply couldn't respond as normal because of how the fire snowballed out of control so rapidly, and residents were left in total disarray and confusion because of the lack of communication between them and their first responders. It's devastating hearing from family members who lost people in the fire because those people felt a false sense of security since they hadn't been given a mandatory evacuation order. It just makes you think about how different the outcome could have been had residents been notified to evacuate as a stronger safety precaution even just 10-20 minutes earlier than what they were actually told. 
<br><br>

Additionally, I was disgusted hearing that PG&E and their negligence was the main cause of this horrific event. The fact that they hadn't checked on or replaced 100 year old power lines is beyond me. I hated how accurate one quote from the film was, that if the corporation was an individual, they would be serving a maximum-term sentence in prison, but because it's a company, they emerge relatively unscathed. California is already so susceptible to devastating fires, mudslides, and other natural disasters solely from climate change, and the fact that human negligence isn't being held more accountable as a major component when it comes to events like this infuriates me. What will it even take for our government, or at least somebody, to even step in and try to hold corporations like PG&E more accountable for their contributions to the climate crisis?

The film "fire in paradise" descriptively shows each and every stage of the tragic "camp" fire and how people responded. At first I thought the film was overdoing the overdramatic card as with all of the suspenseful music, recordings of police calls and sirens, and cinematic shots it reminded me of documentaries of much more catastrophic events such as 9/11. However, as the fire exponentially spread and began to engulf the town I realized that this on the smaller scale of Paradise residents is equivalent to their own version of 9/11. With their entire town being wiped out and innocent lives being lost without warning, it was nothing short of an absolute horrid catastrophe. 

<br><br>

The film truly opened my eyes to the results that occur from a wildfire that grows and turns into a large scale fire. Towns can quickly be destroyed, lives can be taken, and livelihoods can be ruined. I was caught off guard by how quickly these damages occurred and it now being a frequent occurrence in California for wildfires to occur, there is much more safety and precaution that needs to be taken in order to prevent fires and at least decrease their likelihood as they are almost always preventable. In 2020, nearly the entire country of Australia is on fire and is showing us the unfortunate result of preventable fires that get out of hand serving as an immediate call to action for the rest of the world.

It’s hard for me to imagine encountering a mountain fire in this size. It was mentioned in this film that human activities has doubled the mountain fire, which is indeed horrible. One mountain fire could cause damages that can take decades to repair. In recent years, there are many news about mountain fire, so how long does it take to repair all these damages toward natural environment and people suffered from those fires? If more of us can consider the consequences, many of these disasters can be prevented.

The film in paradise is a documentary which record one of the most severe wildfire in last decades. The comparison of the peaceful paradise and the blighted one after the fire really shocked me. The fire started because one power tower of PG&E. Because the company did not turn off the power, the tower failed and burned the surrounding. I think one of the heartbreak parts in this film is that the police tried to save the fire, they found they cannot. The road is too narrow for the fire truck to get on, and the strong wind make the air rescue impossible. He said that he looked at the manageable fire, but he can do nothing. The weakness made him seem so sad. If they can save the fire, it would not finally cause that huge damage. At the same time, I feel more angry to the PG&E company. They knew that the electric tower is old, but they did not fix it. To make more profit, they did not turn off the power in the windy days because they “think” the wind is decreasing. However, PG&E is the most powerful and biggest electricity company in USA. Their authority prevented them to get into the prison. The bureaucracy makes protect environment more difficult. Why the government always try to deceive their people instead of explaining and convincing? This severe fire reminds me of the huge fire in Australia several weeks ago. I saw a video about a firefighter’s opinion on the youtube. He fiercely blamed the Premier about his inaction, which finally cause the forest irreversible consequence and the death of thousands of wild animals. I really hope that the government can pay attention on the fire prevention. We do not have that many forest sources to burn any more.

As Professor Ken mentioned, the film “Fire in Paradise” really did a good job of providing insight into the human condition following the effects of climate change. I think films like this are really important because not only are they informative of a pressing issue, but because they portray this issue in a way that hits close to home. This fire was completely unexpected and as a result, it burned up an area the size of Chicago destroying 14,000 structures and killing 85 people. It was the most destructive natural disaster in 2018 and is directly a result of climate change. In Northern California, summers warmed 2.5 degrees. That in addition to lack of precipitation for 8 months and high wind made what would have been a normal fire, a devastating fire. The fire was almost gravity-defying as the wind blew embers in every direction causing the fire to have multiple paths simultaneously.  I think it is sad because the fire could have been prevented and people could have been saved. The fire started as a failure of high voltage electrical equipment, and what’s worse is that they knew this equipment was old and needed to be replaced and they knew that conditions were risky, but they decided to not shut power off. PG&E was completely negligent in preventing this horrific accident and what makes it worse is that Cal Fire failed to notify the people of Paradise even when the fire was spreading across the canyon at a rate of 80 football fields a minute. Despite the death and destruction, an officer mentioned that he believes they did their best as the fire immediately outpaced all previous preparations. Again I am simply dumbfounded as to what the future holds as scientists predict that over the next century fire size could increase dramatically.

I regard this documentary highly for the way it invoked such a real, genuine concern for the fires that are going to happen in the future, considering how weather conditions are only worsening.The events that led up to, during, and after the fire were so dramatic yet accurate at the same time which was the reason why it moved me into dwelling in the thought that this is a normal occurrence now. Luckily, I haven’t been directly affected by a wild fire at least once. Before watching “Fire in Paradise”, I didn’t have an accurate idea how it would be like to be in the middle of an infectious and rapidly growing fire that is destroying everything you have to lose. The film did a great job in trying to put you in perspective, so that YOU can visually see what it’s like to be under so much pressure and danger.

After watching the PBS documentary, "Fire in Paradise," I came to understand that the horrible wildfire that swept through Paradise, CA is a direct product of the climate crisis and that it is more than a speculation for the future, but a reality for the present.  I felt paralyzed in my seat to hear the stories of families desperately trying to find each other and make it out of the fire that no one had control of.  Exaggerated conditions for the environment are what made the wildfire so destructive and uncontrollable, Paradise had no chance against the fire once it was set in motion.  Above understanding the environmental factors at play in this tragedy, we need to address the corporation responsible for starting the fire in the first place.  PG&E has continuously proven their negligence in distributing power among communities in a safe manner.  Their incompetence is also to blame for the destruction of the area of Concow and Paradise, CA.

Fires are no joke and this film, "Fire in Paradise" does a great job of showcasing just that. After watching this film it was really eye-opening to me that many people suffer drastically due to wildfires. Not only do they lose their homes but they are left emotionally broken and that is just devastating to me. This film made me disappointed in ourselves because we are one of the major causes of these fires, but it also made me want to act now and bring other people along with me to start a clean less toxic lifestyle. 
<br><br>
The pictures, news, social media presented in this film, I believe are very effective in making the viewers recognize the immense dangers we face and hopefully eye-opening to begin the change we need. Although it might be terrifying, the film demonstrates exactly how a fire can quickly get out of control and this is why we need to enact climate and environmental policies to help prevent this disaster of fires which are getting worse each year. I was devastated watching this film because it was heartbreaking watching the people of Paradise and other people have their lives turn upside down due to the wildfires. Overall, this documentary does an excellent job of portraying a picture of that day and shows how everything went from normal to horrific in mere minutes.

This Frontline Documentary was absolutely heartbreaking. Watching the way that this natural disaster affected these people's lives was astonishing. One thing that the film did very well was communicating how unexpected the Camp Fire was. The flame grew incredibly quickly and spread throughout a distance and an area that no one was able to accurately predict. Even the dispatchers that were watching the incident from afar via the many phone calls they were receiving every minute were completely unable to understand the magnitude of the event. One woman was even telling Paradise residents that there was "no threat" posed to them or their communities. And that came less than an hour before the fire hit the town. The fact that authorities were so unequipped to accurately alert residents about the imminent threat just proves how the timescale of this disaster was a phenomenon that was completely unprecedented and completely unprepared for. No one understood what the danger meant until it was literally surrounding them from every direction. Even the firefighters who had the most up to date information about what was happening did not have a very good grasp about where the fire currently was or where it was spreading. And even if they had known the correct numbers and facts, the info wouldn't be very accurate for very long. Furthermore, I don't believe that the firefighters (or anyone trapped in the midst of the disaster) could accurately comprehend how intense and immense the damage was. The blaze was reaching out from every direction and surrounding these people that were literally trying to escape. I cannot imagine how horrifying it must have been to be trapped in a standstill on a thin road with the only "escape" being the direction in front of you which was literally on fire. Another emotion that I felt during the entire film was an overwhelming hopelessness. Although many people in the comments are bringing up the specific actions that certain personnel could have taken to prevent or lessen the tragedy, I believe that line of thinking is misguided. When a catastrophe like this hits, pointing fingers at the overwhelmed individuals actively doing everything in their power to mitigate the damage is useless. If blame is to be dealt, the culprit should be the energy corporation whose negligence allowed for the fire to start in the first place. Trying to attack people that were probably suspended in a state of panic the entire time is unfair and useless. The valiant heroes who fought off the fire deserve nothing but admiration.

The film portrays the heavy situation of the fire in a perfectly mature way for the audience to understand how significantly fires are affecting our world. It emphasizes how the situation was too much for the victims to handle in that moment because it went out of control. The film utilizes videos taken in that moment and involves commentary about the situation, which includes not only how that specific fire is affecting the community involved but also how climate change is happening even more from the increasing amount of wildfire across the globe. The community near the wildfire was affected tremendously, including the hospital where they had to evacuate its patients from further danger. This film reminded that wildfires are extremely problematic for our planet right now and that people's lives are being ruined as well as the environment.

Although I wasn’t physically there, I feel as though there could’ve been more done by the Cal Fire that would have resulted in less chaos, less deaths, and less injuries. Just 45 minutes after the fire started, it spread from a dirt road called Camp Creek Road to Concow, it spread 300 acres. Personally, I feel as though this could’ve been used as an indicator that this fire was different and had the potential to spread rapidly and large distances. Another indicator should’ve been that spot fires were engulfing both sides of the road, when normally spot fires would be 15 to 20 feet. Cal Fire normally notifies Paradise Police if a fire is threatening the town. Since the Cal Fire didn’t evaluate the situation better, they told the Paradise Police that the fire wasn’t a threat whatsoever. As a ripple effect to this, Paradise Police told the civilians that the smoke they were seeing by the canyon was no threat to them and that they shouldn’t be worried. As a result, the town wasn’t immediately evacuated. Some civilians didn’t see it as a threat since they were given no warning, so they stayed in their homes. Specifically for this city, the Paradise Police would notify the civilians through Code Red, but the civilians would’ve had to optionally sign up for it. It’s important to note, more than half the residents weren’t signed up for Code Red and many of those who were signed up still didn’t receive a notification. Essentially, there would’ve been a higher probability of people who survived the fire and the time people all got evacuated by, if the Cal Fire realized the fire was a threat and had told the Paradise Police to notify the civilians. However, it’s not just the Cal Fire that I feel is part of the blame, but also PG&E. After all, they are the ones who are responsible for the fire. PG&E was warned its transmission towers were aging and that components might fail. Instead of trying to improve these components, they thought they could get away with it for a bit longer. It’s crazy how money hungry people can be, that they would risk numerous people’s lives over money.
 <br><br>
   Aside from all the “what-ifs” that are going through my head with this situation, there were a lot of stories in this documentary that touched my heart. After 2 hours and 6 minutes from the start of the fire, that hospital in Paradise was evacuated. People who were getting out of surgery were immediately being loaded into the cars or vans for evacuation. That’s insane to think about, think about it. You might already be worried about complications in your surgery and as soon as you gain any sort of consciousness, you’re being loaded into some sort of vehicle, questioning yourself what now. Nurse Nichole Jolly told her story about being on the phone with her husband believing that she was going to die by the fire. Hearing her voice as she told her story, broke my heart. I even started to imagine how rough it must have been for her husband. Imagine starting off the day business as usual, and now the love of your life is at risk. Imagine being on the phone with someone you love so deeply and not knowing whether or not that will be the last time you’ll ever hear their voice again. The story that absolutely broke my heart was the story that one of the policemen told. He picked up the phone and a woman along with two other individuals were trapped in the house. The house is on fire, they’re in a room that doesn’t have any windows, the doors in that room that would lead out to the rest of the house is on fire. While the man was on the phone with her, her side went static and then silent. He had to press the next call and start all over again. I couldn’t help but imagine how helpless that woman must’ve felt with all the conditions trapping her in a room that will soon also be on fire. How guilty and weak the man must’ve felt being on the phone, knowing she most likely would die and he couldn’t do anything about it. 
<br><br>
    The fact that this fire at one point was visible from space is so crazy for me to comprehend. It took only 4 hours for the whole town of Paradise to be destroyed, four hours for people’s lives to be altered from there on out.

After watching the film “ Fire in Paradise”, I felt shocked that not only the climate change result in the fire in California, but also some people who build their house illegally cause the fire. Since the global warming, the wildfire in California are the result of lack of rainfall. The global warming become more serious because of the wildfire. Also, people who build their house with woods are also the cause of the wildfire. Many people were reluctant to leave their homes and rebuilt houses in the original disaster area, which also led to the wildfires. Many families privately hired firefighters to put out fires, resulting in chaos and inefficiency. This fire is not only a natural disaster, but also a man-made disaster。

The documentary "Fire in Paradise" is one of the most personal documentaries that I could relate to because I felt the effects of what happened. While the Paradise fires were going on, the ash and smoke traveled to the Central Valley where I lived at the time and got trapped in our valley due to the geography for weeks. I knew why our air was like the way it was from the news or whatever but after watching "Fire in Paradise" it brings a whole new context to what happened. The devastation that was brought upon the community of Paradise is heartbreaking for everyone that was involved and the documentary really showed me that. Another aspect that I found to be impactful is how it affected me. Here there was something going on so far away yet people in my area were still affected, much similar to how climate change affects people all over the world that have impact on it. Our actions have many consequences all over the world and no one ever knows for certain what may happen or what may be destroyed because of something that happens in the world far away.

More than READING about the impacts of climate change or HEARING someone else state the facts and statistics on the magnitude or probability of a catastrophic event occurring, watching this film, seeing footage of the Camp Fire and, in a sense, being face-to-face with victims of the fire has made me realize how lightly I have been taking not only this class, but the climate crisis overall. I always thought it was a bit dramatic to call it a climate CRISIS as opposed to simply viewing the status quo as a drastic change in climate. However, this film really opened my eyes to how close and quickly this climate crisis is affecting people; this really cannot be ignored just because I or someone isn't directly being affected. 

<br><br>

The Thomas Fire occurred and spread during my first year at UCSB and while I was surprised to realize how much the fire spread, it never occurred to me until now that it could've been much worse and that I and many others were simply lucky that the fire wasn't as severe as the Camp Fire. The jokes and memes about the Thomas Fire on the Internet were funny then, but seeing "Fire in Paradise" really put things into perspective and made me feel somewhat ashamed that I was laughing while people in Montecito and neighboring cities lost homes and loved ones.

I really appreciate the video and article assigned this week because they really put into perspective how imminent affects of the climate crisis are. As someone who was fortunate enough to be born and raised in the state of California, survival has never been a huge concern for me. Despite earthquakes, there never was a threat of a large scale natural disaster jeopardizing those around me. Now seeing this video, I realize how impending this catastrophe really is. As already established in the article, this is a problem many of us face. We know the problem of climate change exists but have no first hand experience on how it affects the lives of others.
<br><br>
The fact that the fire spread so quickly is personally the most jarring part for me. Initially, the fire seemed like a small incident that could be fixed in small time. However, due to a variety of, in my opinion, unforeseen circumstances, an entire city was engulfed in flames within 4 hours. According to the video, the fire was burning at around 80 football fields a minute, which is literally unfathomable to imagine for me. What makes this even more concerning is the fact that there was a fire in the area very recently, close enough that SB had to cancel classes temporarily.

Being born and raised in California I have definitely noticed the environmental changes that our state has been subjected to. For almost all my life I have lived at the bottom of a mountain range in Southern California. Growing up, from what I remember, there were hardly ever any fires at all. It wasn’t up until about my first year of high school that I noticed them becoming more and more regular. At first they started as small containable ones; however every year they gradually grew larger and more consistent. One  year ago the mountain ranges above us were struck by the Holy fire which burned for over a month. Since then it’s felt like fires have began to feel like the norm; however this should definitely not be the case. For it to be normal to have various fires a year causing destruction to the environment, wildlife and in many cases people should not be something we should simply come to accept. I think the Paradise Fire should definitely serve as a learning lesson for other cities that are at high risk to fires. It’s devastating  to know that dozens of lives could have been saved if there had been a better and more organized evacuation procedure. I think there needs to come a point where we need to stop worrying so much about the cost of something like expanding roads and just do it because as proven by the paradise fire it could act as a matter of a life or death situation.

As I was watching this short documentary, I found myself empathizing with the people recalling how they felt during the time when the camp fire was active. I mean, how could you not? You could see the pain in the eyes of the nurse who was separated from her husband, and the eyes of the granddaughter who did not know about the whereabouts of her grandfather until a while after the fire was put out. This show depicted real people who experiences a real consequence of the climate crisis. You can be given stacks of statistics about how the Earth is dying, but receiving a firsthand account of people who lost loved ones and came close to death themselves really does make the climate crisis seem that much more real and frightening. You look at the people who experienced the camp fire and wonder if you're destined for the same fate if the climate keeps deteriorating at the rate that it is. It should not take something like the fire in paradise to happen to people in order for them to want to help the earth. There are preventative measures that can be taken in order to ensure that fires like the camp fire do not get so out of hand, and I think something like this should urge people to take those measures into heavy consideration.

“Fire in Paradise” is a touching and heart-breaking movie. Just like its name, this movie documented the Camp Fire happened a year ago, this tragedy brought painful distractions to a once beautiful environment in a few hours. One of the special part about this movie is that it is told by people who experienced the fire and lived from it, and it used first-person footage of the fire to put you back in the situation and have stronger feelings. This 40 minuets movie recorded the worst of the fire and the lingering effects of trauma, it is here to remind us to not forget about the past, and alarm us to protect the future.

While watching "Fire in Paradise", I felt a small connection to it. Being from the San Fernando Valley, there is always a major fire every year around the month of October and most of the time we are told to evacuate no matter if the fire very close or not. These poor people of Paradise had a very late last minute warning or not even a warning at all. Many people had so many worries and were told by dispatchers to remain calm but in just a few minutes they would have their backyards on fire. I could not imagine being trapped in my car attempting to evacuate while being surrounded by flames. This film gave me a new perspective of being in a fire and that having a plan for any type of catastrophic event is very important.

The film show very interestingly  how it things become out of control before anyone could find it.As temperatures continue to increase and climates  get drier, fires are becoming more harmful to the environment. The discrepancy  between enforcement and the reality that follows a disaster such as a fire tells us that no matter how much humanity may prepare, at times mother nature will simply outmatch them.it presents us with the main cause, which is climate change.  The climate change may contribute to the global sea level rise to over half of the total population in the world. When hearing about the wildfire in California, I feel really sad and sympathetic for those who has endured from the substantial losses of their families and the things they cherished. But it really alarmed us and gave us a lesson that if we mistreated the nature, the nature would in turn "reciprocate" us. In fact, at present, the majority of climate change is caused by human activities rather than natural patterns,Climate crisis would influence everyone of us on this planet, and when it truly come, none of us can escape. So why don't we shoulder up the responsibility from right now and try our best to protect the environment?

The fire in Paradise actually impacted my family personally - one of my cousins lived in Paradise, and he had to leave his home when he was awoken suddenly and unexpectedly, and physically run from the fire which was spreading rapidly. I remember when I heard about it I was shocked, as I didn’t before realize that the wildfires in California could be that directly life-threatening. 
<br><br>

The documentary made me sad to see the ways that the fire could have been prevented or that the situation could have been less deadly. PG&E’s incompetence and negligence was why the fire began in the first place, which is more frustrating than if it was just due to natural causes, because it could have been prevented. PG&E also did not pay the fair consequences, as the film explains that if the company were an individual person then they would be in prison for the damage inflicted. It annoys me that just because it is a corporation, it isn’t held to the same standards as individuals. It was also frustrating to see how the people of Paradise were not informed enough or efficiently by the fire department, and how there was not sufficient communication between officials and the citizens. However, even with all of the human error, climate change still exacerbated the fire - because of high winds and dry land.
<br><br>

The documentary was very emotional, and it was extremely sad to see the up close and personal effects of the fire on real people and families. I think the emotional appeal was more effective at showing the consequences of climate change than any numbers or statistics could be.

The PBS documentary, "Fire in Paradise", was very emotional to watch. When the officer described a phone call with a resident of Paradise who was trapped in her house with two other people and he couldn't help them, my heart broke. Growing up in Santa Barbara and Montecito, I have experienced many similar fires first hand and there is nothing scarier than knowing theres something so uncontrollable coming for you. Two years ago the Thomas Fire destroyed the hills of Montecito and shortly after, heavy rains caused a devastating mudslide. It was "the perfect storm" that destroyed my small town. Waking up to my street covered in a foot of mud and flood water was the scariest thing I have ever experienced. Both the Paradise Fire and Thomas Fire started from power companies but the intensity of the fire was definitely because of global warming and our very own climate crisis. It makes me so frustrated that neither companies, PG&E (killing 85 people) and SoCal Edison (killing 15 people in the fire and 23  in the mudslide caused from the fire), did not face SEVERE punishments. While it was our very dry climate and lack of rain that made these fires so huge, I think the companies should be held responsible for the damage they caused. The intensity of these fires have been so unnatural and I think that goes to show that we really are in a climate crisis.

The documentary shows a most visual aspect of a wildfire in California. When I watched it I was shock. I knew California is suffering wildfires every year, and this is a serious effect of climate change, but this is the first time I watch a documentary describing about the things happened during and after the fire. These are terrified and heartbreaking moments. People who experienced the fire know the serious effect of the climate change, but the rest of us who didn't experience have few clear idea about the power of nature. As a result, the film directly shows the audience the serious consequences of the climate change. 
<br><br>
Fires endanger wildlife, plants, lands and cause large damage to the environment and ecosystem. Animal extinction and soil degradation can be the bad consequences. Except for fires, the world is also experiencing global warming. Global warming may be one of the causes of the wildfire in California because the annual temperature is raising and the air here is dry. The effect of global warming does not only influence a small place, but the overall world. Some islands are drown. Some cities near the sea are attacked by floods. The climate change originally caused by humans is repaying us with disasters which we cannot handle. 
<br><br>
The step after the realization is making the change. Regulations are needed to proceed. I hope we can work together to reduce  the disasters happened around us and the effect of climate change.

After watching the documentary “Fire in Paradise,” I felt incredibly sad and devastated as I saw how the fire in Paradise affected the lives of so many people. It was pretty terrifying to see how quickly the fire spread and how most of the people were still in Paradise when the fire had reached Paradise. It was horrible to see how late the responders and residents were notified to evacuate. I definitely think that if people were notified sooner, the number of lives lost would not have been as high. The scene of the patients and hospital staff evacuating the hospital and the scenes where the cars were stuck in traffic as the fire burned around them were very intense and hard to watch. 
<br><br>


This was a very eye opening documentary for me. I had not previously thought about just how devastating a fire could be. It was so heartbreaking to see all the people lose so much within only a few hours. While on the surface, the issue does not seem to be super related to the climate crisis, the severity of the issue was definitely because of the climate crisis. If it had not been so dry and windy, the fire would not have spread so quickly and maybe a town would have been spared. Overall, I thought this was a great documentary on the increasingly serious issue of wildfires.

After watching Fire in Paradise I feel like I’ve literally been living under a rock. I had no clue that this wildfire had happened or any that had occurred in Northern California. The most popular fire that I knew of was the Getty fire, and it probably has to due to celebrities being involved and because I’m from Southern California. I found this documentary to be very interesting and loved the structure. It shows us different points of the view from the 911 dispatcher, an RN who was in the hospital during evacuation occurred, to a daughter who had to leave her mother behind due to the lack of importance the fire got.
<br><br>
As it starts, it presents us with the main cause, which is climate change. There are high-temperature winds and no rain has occurred during the 8 months. During the film, I was mad and sadden to see that many people lost their lives and the lack of preparation caused harm for many. They show that they had evacuation routes by zones, but never saw the entire city affected by a fire. The part that got me mad was the fact that code red wasn’t utilized instead, they sent out a message to the people who had signed up for alerts, which was less than ½, and some of the people didn’t even receive it. I felt sad for the teenager who had to leave her mother behind since she didn’t see the fire as a big issue. In my opinion, many lives could’ve been save if the evacuation would be started at least 5 mins earlier and when the concerned people were calling the police. From this film, I was able to see the impact a wildfire does to the community, from the loss of land to the death of family members.

The way this horrible fire played out in Paradise makes for an unusual natural disaster. It is crazy to see how many things came hand in hand in this destruction of the town of Paradise. Had only PG&E fixed the old equipment or turned off the power that day, the fire would not have happened. Had only the people of Paradise been warned earlier, no one or at least less than 85 people would have died. Had only the town been more prepared with a better plan, no one or at least less than 85 people would have died. We can go on and on and think of these possibilities, but ultimately what fueled this horrible fire and natural disaster was because of our actions. What fueled this fire was the lack of care for the environment that we have. What fueled this fire was the bad weather conditions caused by the climate crisis that we have created. This is not to say that PG&E and that town’s plan are not to be blamed, but huge natural disasters like these can be prevented if we begin to take care of our planet. 
 <br><br>

The film does a great job of giving us all the necessary information of the fire including the time stamps throughout the day. The film also does a great job at touching and affecting the viewer in an emotional way. I am glad the film did this because it is an effective way to really implement this into peoples minds. The film made me really sad at times due to the horrifying stories of some of the victims. I can’t imagine how terrifying it must be to feel trapped and just be surrounded by fire. I hope that all the surviving victims of this fire are fine and doing well. It’s just really crazy to think that this fire comes nowhere near to being as destructive as the fires in Australia.

“Fire In Paradise” is one of the most scary and heartbreaking things I have ever seen. I honestly wanted to stop watching the film during many scenes because I felt overwhelmed, as if I were experiencing the fire along with everyone else as well. This is due to the footage of the fire engulfing the entire town, along with the fear, panic, sadness, and other emotions that were expressed by the witnesses of the fire. The first-hand perspective that is utilized in the film hits differently than a simple news story. This film is highly effective at providing a consistent narrative, while simultaneously showing the different perspectives of people that were affected by the fire. The fire department, police department, and residents all had different sides of the story to share, and I think it was important to understand the elements that created such a destructive fire, the miscommunication and unpreparedness of the authorities involved, the helplessness of the residents, and other factors that made what initially seemed to be a normal fire so deadly.
 <br><br>
The part that stood out to me the most is when the authorities at the end stated that they performed the best they could in reaction to the fire. It seemed like they could have set up a better emergency evacuation plan and notified residents sooner. But at the same time, they were highly unprepared for the disaster that occurred since Paradise was perceived to be a safe space. This makes me think that an unanticipated event of this magnitude could potentially occur at other places as a result of climate change, and those regions would also be facing the same lack of order. No place and no one is guaranteed to be safe, and no amount of technology, money, or other resources can change that due to the unprecedented consequences of climate change.





</p><hr>



<p>
This film is almost surreal to me. As I watched more and more of it I could not believe that the footage was real. Watching how the fire was progressing at such a fast rate and unstoppable. No one was prepared for a situation like this. Doctors and nurses were helping evacuate patients with their own personal vehicles. Climate change has really affected these natural disasters and made them even harder to control and deal with. Thousands of lives were affected by this fire. It destroyed many homes and land. 
  <br><br>
I can not imagine the feelings and thoughts that these people were experiencing throughout this crisis. It was all very chaotic to the point where firefighters were not even trying to stop the fire anymore but to save people. This fire was just one of the many more natural disasters to come. Maybe next time it won’t be a fire but a hurricane, or maybe a tornado. It does not matter because we will not be able to control it as temperatures will continue to rise.

<p>

The film Fire in Paradise demonstrates the major consequences that we face from droughts. They mentioned that California now only sees rain in December, early January and that it is quite concerning that we could have up to 8 months of no rain fall. At this point, as they also mentioned, the dry fuels become explosives then leading to a catastrophe such as this fire. 
  <br><br>
Hearing the residents’ and firefighters’ worries during this time was very sad. I can’t even imagine how they felt not being able to take action immediately because of the location of where the fire began and the strong winds. One of the firefighters did mention that they had no intelligence of how fast the fire was spreading because they went straight into rescuing the residents.
  <br><br>
 
It is frightening to think that the residents weren’t aware that the fire was close by. They didn’t give out any warnings and failed to communicate. I think they mainly failed to communicate because no one was able to take action as the fire rose. In moments like these, it is very sad to know that they didn’t have an evacuation plan for the whole town. This shows how unexpected the fire spread upon them.
  <br><br>
 
It is very heartbreaking to see that the fire outpaced all the resources and planning. In this situation, the people had to be responsible for their own safety. Climate change has been affecting us in making fires bigger and frequent. If 10 out of the 20 have happened in the last four years what awaits us. It’s frightening to think that it only took 4 hours for fire to cover whole town.

Your statement "If 10 out of the 20 [fires] have happened in the last four years what awaits us" makes me think about just how severe fires are and will become in California. It is one thing to say that climate change caused disasters will continue to occur, but another to think in sheer numbers, based on the trend in fires, of what is basically guaranteed to happen. Having said that, I wonder if other regions in California are taking measures to prevent being unprepared in case of fires. Otherwise, something like the situation in Paradise could likely become a problem elsewhere.
  <br><br>
It is scary, indeed, that residents did not know that they were in imminent danger. Not only were they uninformed of the fire nearby, but even when they were able to see the fire getting closer from outside their windows, upon calling the police, they were reassured that they did not need to take any action. To think that the authorities that residents rely on were misinforming them and giving them a false sense of safety is sad and also terrifying.

My parents used to live in paradise. I remember the day this fire was burning and I remember my parents showing me on a fire map where they used to live, not too far away from the fire itself. Less than an hour later, their old house was past gone.
  <br><br>


I felt like I was watching a horror movie when watching Fire in Paradise. I think that was partly because of the anticipatory background music, but also partly because this was a true story and those are real videos of people struggling to stay alive. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have nightmares that involve being burned alive or stuck in a burning town or house.

  <br><br>


We need to wake up. Yes, PG&E started the fire, but no it would not have happened at that capacity if we were not in the middle of a TERRIFYING CLIMATE CRISIS. Videos like these are what it will take to wake up the morally lazy folk, and by then it is too late. We can't wait for a natural disaster to happen to take action. WE MUST START TAKING ACTION NOW.

Throughout watching this film, the main effect it had on me was frustration. The mass amount of calls police dispatchers were receiving from locals in paradise about a fire, yet they continued to tell them they were safe, was where my frustration began. So many lives could have been saved had they announced an evacuation notice sooner. People were reporting ashes raining on their homes, yet dispatchers continued to tell them they were safe, when clearly, they were not. As frustrating as it was to watch, and as easily it is to put the blame on someone, toward the end of the documentary I began to realize that the main people to blame for extreme fires such as this one, is ourselves. As it was stated in the film, California has experienced an increased amount of fires in the past four years. As extreme as these fires have been, if the temperature continues to increase throughout the next few years, we will be experiencing even more severe fires than those we’ve already witnessed. These fires are just one of the many effects climate change has on our environment, which is why we should ultimately put the blame on ourselves for tragedies such as this one. It’s clear that if we don’t take serious action soon, events such as these will become even more regular than they already are, along with becoming more powerful.

Watching the film was heartbreaking and also upsetting. Growing up and living in California, hearing and seeing all this breaks my heart because this is home. In this film listening to the stories of some of the survivors made me happy because they had the chance to get out but not everyone was as lucky. Hearing the stories of people that passed away in this fire is so sad because their family members know exactly how and it paints this picture in their heads that is incredibly heartbreaking. So many people losing their homes due to a company being irresponsible.
  <br><br>
This film takes the viewer through the progression of the fire, what was once a small fire turned into a huge monster that destroyed a whole town. This was a preventable fire but due to negligence, a whole town burned town and took away 85 peoples lives. In this situation PG&E knew about but neglected to replace some of their towers. A malfunction started the fire and the changes in the environment took it and turned it into the deadliest wildfire in California history. At first I didn’t really think much of climate change’s role in this fire but quickly realized what its role was. California gets so much hotter during the summer and it starts to extend into the fall, everything is drier and there is less rain. While climate change isn’t starting the fires, it's what develops them in to the deadly fires they can be. I think in someway people are like PG&E, we know about the issue, in our case climate crisis, and what we need to do to try and resolve the issue but we neglect to do so.

I really enjoyed watching this film, it hit really close to home for me. As I mentioned in my last comment about the article we read this week, I had first hand experience with the ravaging fires throughout California. This film hit very close to home for me especially in the beginning with the clips with people calling 9/11 questioning whether or not their home was safe from the fires. 

  <br><br>

During the Sonoma County Fires(where I live) so many people were completely bewildered and confused about what was happening to their home and the environment around them. The grandparents even had to evacuate their retirement home because the fire was right next to them. This film showed me that fires were a much more detrimental issue throughout California than I had ever thought. My grandparents had to be evacuated from their home and rushed to a temporary home in a gymnasium with hundreds of other people. The effects of the fires were imaginable but I haven't thought about the detrimental effects since a year ago when it happened to my home in particular. Watching this film showed me that I shouldn't be brushing off the detrimental effects of the fire, I should continue to be worried about it and know that it will still continue in California. In the past, I didn't realize that the fires in California were the effect of climate change, but in realizing that now it scares me much more because now I know that these fires are just the start, it is going to get much worse.




</p><hr>



<p>
After watching the film, I felt such a great disappointment in humanity. Not only did we create this extremely detrimental punishment, but we also fail to come to terms with the reality we face as the climate crisis sets in. I was incredibly frustrated when claims in regards to the preparedness of Paradise fires were mentioned. The evacuation plan was practiced in 2008 and was last modified in the early 2000s. The reality we face today is nowhere near a match to past conditions. We must accept that climate change is real and prepare adequate in order to protect ourselves. We can not deny the climate crisis any longer and continue to prioritize other issues such as the economy. PG&E made it very clear that their only concern is their profit, why should we make their corporational gain our priority? 

  <br><br>

This tragedy goes to show that climate change is not a political issue. This is the biggest test we will face in my life time that will not exclude anyone regardless of their differences. With climate change it does not target a specific area on the planet and create havoc. It creates the perfect "package" with all elements present to destroy the surrounding area. I think its very important to mention that other issues such as healthcare, the economy, and social security will not matter if we do not have a home to live in. We treat climate change as if it is controlled and will subside. If we do not pay through our efforts in order to create a positive contribution we will have to pay through more dire alternatives in the future.

  <br><br>

We seem to forget that we are mortal. The actions we take part in now will have consequences on ourselves and the future generations in the near future.How many more catastrophes do we have to go through? How many more loved ones do we have to lose? How close must it get to our homes?

I feel trembling when I saw this week’s film. Currently, the fire in Australia keeps everyone’s attention. It keeps burning, animals are getting hurt and losing their habitats, people are running from their loving home. Heard before, right? This happened in Thomas Fire in California, the Ranch Fire, every possible wildfire that would threaten the human. Heartbroken is the word that mostly when people try to describe the wildfire, since most of people may not have close experience about wildfire. But from my perspective about wildfire, the only word I can imagine right now is horrible. 
  <br><br>

It makes people have to flee from their old houses, beautiful town and enjoyable time in there, it causes nearly irreversible damage to the place near to the fire point; it leads the trend of climate change. To be honest, wildfire is a nightmare that no one can escape from it. Since the climate change, the weather gets dryer that potential leading the wildfire, and the wildfire causes the change in climate. It just like an endless cycle.

This film did an amazing job humanizing the effects of the climate crisis. As students, it can be easy for us to identifying the underlying causes of climate change. However, recognizing the real effects climate change has on people depends on learning from real events and stories. Although this fire was not started directly because of climate change, the results of dry land and fast wind speeds due to climate change caused the fire to spread rapidly. Its effects were deviating and have left a lasting impact that we must learn from.
  <br><br>

I believe this film covered a vast amount of information, spanning from the beginning of the fire to its aftermath today. It’s shocking to believe that preventative measures from PG&E could have stopped this fire from happening. This film emphasizes the message that it is important for all members of a community (residents, government officials, utility companies) to do their part during times of emergencies. It is clear that more could have been done to prevent the fires from starting. Additionally, more people could have been evacuated if they had been given the right information and resources. However, as this film shows, it is incredibly difficult for people to evacuate due to the emotional ties associated with their homes. I hope this film will encourage people to learn more about the preventative measures and emergency plans around climate crises in their neighborhood to prevent another incident like this from happening again.

This film gave a very real and uncensored glimpse into the disasters all around us. It showed us the pain these families are going through that live in high-risk zones. They don't know what's to come each time around and that's the most terrifying thing about it all. They never know what or who they will lose. The young girl speaking about her victimized grandfather towards the end really stuck out to me. They found his body 2 weeks later. All that was left of him was his wheelchair in the backyard. To think of such a thing happening to my very own grandfather is heart wrenching and unbearable. These stories will only get worse and I feel for these people. I feel the pain in their voices. These individuals speaking out should help convince many others to come to the conclusion that the earth needs us now more than ever. It's definitely helped me realize that I need to start making changes in my own life to help better the environment.

I decided to watch the "Fire In Paradise" documentary with a friend so that we can have back and forth discussions/ commentary and honestly the film left us speechless. It was not what I expected. The severity of wildfires were beyond my expectations and honestly the documentary really touched me. My friend compared it to a suspenseful movie. The sad part is that it was only the horrors of reality. None of that movie magic. It was raw footage of the horror stories that many civilians faced. These are they types of videos that should be spreading around to open the eyes of others and realize that climate change is real. It's here and it going to continue to be here if we don't do anything about it. It really did touch me and make me ponder about our current evacuation routes and zones are accurate and up to date. Just because it hasn't happened to doesn't mean it won't. The rising temperatures now serve as a catalyst for such events and we need to do something. Starting with raising awareness would be a step in the right direction.

The film really gave an honest lens of what happened at paradise in 2018. There are some things that I never knew: that fire happens so often that people are becoming complacent. One of the things that stood out was that dispatchers at Paradise told citizens to not evacuate and that they are safe. I feel that that's such a crazy thing to say. What if instead of saying that, they mentioned something like if you feel unsafe, please fine your way out, please prepare for any emergency that may happen. Pack some water and some first aid kit and bring your valuables and dip. It just doesn't make sense. IF you see ash raining down, just go. 
  <br><br>
Moreover, I did not know that they could not drive a fire truck out to the origin of the fire. I did not know that at a decision to shut down power to prevent fire, people would say no just because of uncertain weather predictions saying the wind will slow down.

I have nightmares about fires like the Camp Fire.

  <br><br>

I remember the sudden panic that engulfed me as a brush fire sprang up ahead of me on Pacheco Pass, the anger I felt as the brake lights came on ahead of me, the adrenaline as the heat hit my passenger door and the smell of smoke seeped in. In that moment of terror, I was flooded with memories of the scenes of destruction on that familiar stretch of 101, scenes that I consumed almost as a penance for my own escape from the Thomas Fire, when UCSB belatedly prioritized the safety and health of their students.

  <br><br>

I've become more afraid of fires than anything in the last few years. The sense of freedom that the survivor shared in "Fire in Paradise" as the sky finally opened up is palpable to me, while my life was never immediately threatened by the Thomas Fire, my emotional health was.  I, like the residents of the town of Paradise, am terrified more by the lack of sirens than anything else when I see a thick, unknown plume of smoke by the road. It's a potent reminder that humans are not in control, that I have to run like every other animal. Sometimes the car and the road feel more like a prison than a means of escape. I've looked up how my car would fare driving straight through flames, and I've very nearly had to test it. 

  <br><br>

I think my generation's subconscious has become heavy with the pain of climate change. The intimate scenes in this documentary don't feel foreign, they feel like my fear-dreams come alive. If the hope of this film in the context of the course was to remind me how close to home the climate crisis is, consider it a job well done.

I was never afraid of fires until a couple years ago, but now I'm terrified too. It was always one of those things that were too far away from me for it to be an actual fear. But a couple years ago my school was canceled because of fire dangers. At first, I was happy because school was canceled, but then I realized that I was actually in danger and it was a serious issue. This made me realize that most people don't really care about issues that don't affect them. But by the time everyone is affected by climate change in a significant way, it's going to be too late. It's been predicted that half of my hometown is going to be underwater by the end of the century, but the only people that care about are the ones that are going to be financially impacted by the flooding. We need to show people how grim our future is going to be if we don't act now.

The Paradise Fire just shows us how much the climate change will change our lives in the future. Even for a place where fire breaks out regularly during hot summer season, even for a place where one of the most elaborate evacuation plan (if not the most) in the United States is developed, Paradise did not stand a chance against this combination of human faults and climate change. In the video, the fire department, the police department, along with their evacuation plan, were all outpaced by the wildfire within four hours. Yes, of course the emergency response and the evacuation plan can be improved, but it really shows how much it has changed when a plan like this that has worked for decades starts to fall apart. The cost of climate change really will be much larger if we don’t start to change now.

The film "Fire in Paradise" hits close to home; I have always been aware of the impact that natural disasters can have on a community but when such catastrophe occurs in a place you know, in the state in which you live, it becomes so much more real. The film is a rude awakening to the real-time effects that we ourselves are actively causing due to our lavish fossil-fuel lifestyles. The Paradise fire was a highly unfortunate event that wiped out a whole city, a whole community, and a whole bunch of lives. The film, I feel, does an excellent job in painting the narrative of that day in which the city turned to ruins. It appeals to the heart, to the consciousness of a habitant of this planet by allocating the spotlight on victims that recall and explain their first-hand experiences in "literal hell." No city deserves what the town Paradise, California has endured but the reality of the matter is that if we do not start doing our part, we put ourselves and others around the world at risk for a higher degree of a natural disaster. We are indeed living in the middle of a global emergency, and if we continue to recklessly attack our atmosphere with absurd carbon dioxide and methane deposits, mother nature will not be able to keep her calm.

The film "Fire in Paradise" made me realize how drastic the indirect effects of climate change can be. It's easy to spot certain natural disasters and blame them entirely on climate change but this film showed me how it can also heighten the lethality potential. The film did a good job inflicting emotions on the viewer because not only did I feel hopeless while watching the documentary also felt like a horror movie. The sad reality of the movie is that without the strong emotions humans will continue not caring about climate change and it takes something this devastating to cause people to care.

The film "Fire In Paradise" tells us about that fire with a lot of real footage. It moves the focus from the story to the real potential reason of wildfire. The climate change, long-last drought, and hot summer can cause the horrible wildfire. I can't image the pain of those who experienced that fire. From the film, we can see not only the houses and possessions but also many lives have been taken from the fire. We must do something to prevent the tragedy happen again.

When I watched the documentary “Fire in Paradise”, I felt a mixture of emotions: sadness, shock, anger, relief, but most of all, horror. Perhaps the moment where the situation really struck me was when the evacuation of the hospital was shown, and then the footage showing the same area just minutes later covered in embers from the flames surrounding it. The fact that the fire was able to engulf the town in a matter of mere hours was the most horrific part about it. I feel sadness over those who lost their lives to the fires because of how preventable all of this was in hindsight. Communications and infrastructure could have been improved to have the evacuation proceed more smoothly, but the underlying cause of this was the mismanagement of PG&E in maintaining their powerlines. While we can’t change what happened in this incident, we can place the pressure on companies to learn from it so that something like it never occurs again instead of allowing them to get away with their sheer negligence and disregard for the consequences of their actions.

I've lived in California for all my life, yet the effects of climate change on my home state has always felt so foreign to me. I've been fortunate to grow up in the suburbs east of Los Angeles, where the threat of wildfire is always present, but just far enough to pretend it isn't actually happening. It's always someone else's problem, someone else's family, someone else's home, and someone else's loss. While the Cave fire last quarter was certainly scary, "Fire in Paradise" served as incredible insight into the reality that many people in California have had to grow accustomed to. Never once have I stopped to consider the implications of evacuation, having to suddenly gather your life and go, with only the prayer that your home and memories survive. 
  <br><br>

This film was definitely hard to watch, yet simultaneously a work of art. The juxtaposition of the professionally shot scenes of calm forests with the shaky, raw footage of the fire was brilliant. The commentary given by the firemen was chilling at times, and the overall direction of the film is responsible for the impact it had on not only me, but the rest of my classmates who watched it. Ken always stresses the importance of educating the masses on the climate crisis, and films like "Fire in Paradise" are definitely one of the best ways to have a large impact.

This documentary did a great job in changing people’s perceptions towards climate change through illustrating the negative consequences of climate change on humans. It shows the progression of such natural catastrophe, the Paradise Fire, and how it ruined the lives and communities of people living there. Although I did not experience it in person, I could imagine how destructive and severe it was to the locals, and even the fire with smaller scale happened months ago in SB was frightening enough for me. People should not continuously defy the powerful nature or we will get the punishments that we deserve.

Frontline's "Fire in Paradise" was an incredibly insightful episode concerning the rapid chain of catastrophic events that occurred in Paradise, California as a result of climate change and the impact it had on the community after the flames had subsided. They did a lovely job of utilizing footage of the event with commentary from people who actually experienced the raging fire to add gravity to what happened. What made this particular story so heartbreaking was that 85 people died as a result of the fire, which was a consequence of dry weather, corporate neglect, and poor transportation routes. Had climate change not existed as a result of our carbon footprint, then maybe the fire would have been more manageable. Hopefully, shows like Frontline help inform people about the importance of countering climate change.

Fire in Paradise is a great documentary movie for any audience. People often think the wildfires are far away, since I am a kid from New York. After spending time in California, I found that the wildfires are pretty close to human territory. This film gives me an even closer perspective to the fire. The frontline shows a lot of close-up real footages of the fire. It not only destroys trees, but also people's homes. The interviews of these firefighters introduce the audiences to a different point of view. Also, the interviews of the people who were affected by the fires, their lives were once risked. Even worse, 85 lives were lost in that single fire. The fire is not 100 miles away; not 10 miles away; not 1 miles away; but 1 meter away. Fire cannot be controlled, it is like a monster that destroys every single thing it passes through.
  <br><br>

One part of the film is the interview of a 9-1-1 call responder who received a call from a woman. Three people were trapped in a fired room, and after 9 minutes the phone was dead. This is a really sad story!
  <br><br>

Paradise town is a town that is well prepared for fire, but it is never completely prepared. The evacuation plan is hard to make early, because the fire situation is unpredictable. Even though the fire department and the police department are planned, this particular fire happened too fast and moved too fast. Preparation for the fire is never a solution, but elimination is. Government should make laws to counteract the climate crisis.

This documentary did a great job in piecing together the events of the Camp Fire. I honestly couldn’t believe what I was watching was a documentary. It looked like something straight out of a movie. It was also crazy to see just how fast this fire spread and destroyed everything in its path. One moment everything is normal and the next smoke begins to fill the sky. It was scary to see just how many people were contacting 911 and being told that everything is fine and moments later the whole town needed to be evacuated. The entire town turned dark in the middle of the day due to the fire. The film stated that it only took 4 hours for all of Paradise to be burned down. 
  <br><br>
It was sad to hear that most of the casualties of the fire were people over the age of 65. One was that of the lady’s mother who was being stubborn about not wanting to evacuate since they were not told that they needed to. Many people were not informed that they needed to evacuate until it was too late.
  <br><br>
In Ken’s video I was surprised to hear that Australia’s fire was 4 times larger than the 15 largest fires in the history of California. I knew that it was a huge fire but not of that magnitude. It is terrifying to think about a fire of that magnitude occurring here.

The film Fire in Paradise really encapsulated the damage that is being brought upon our own communities by the pressing issue of wildfires. The Camp Fire in 2018 took an astonishing number of acres of land, vegetation, and people. Ken makes the point that the fires didn't have to burn more acres to be considered the most destructive, but rather how devastating they were to the community around them. It was considered not only the most destructive natural disaster in California in the year of 2018, but in the world. The aftermath of the fires is present by the mud and debris slides that took place after, an intense downpour that carried large boulders with it. The film took a different approach in presenting the story of this tragedy. Instead of a typical narration, the event was unfold by first hand sources and witnesses who had footage, as well as calls to dispatch. Interviews with survivors of the fire were truly heartbreaking to witness as it really put into perspective the severity of the situation. Wildfires are becoming more and more common, as a great proportion of the number of wildfires have taken place during the 21st century. I liked how the film wasn't just generally about climate change, but really honed in on one specific effect that is a result of it. Climate change as a concept can be hard to understand because of its broad nature, but focusing on certain effects helps the public understand its multifaceted dangers in detail.

Fire in Paradise is a very informative documentary. There is no narration at all in this film. This film uses real-time footage and interviews of town residents, police, and fireman. This tight, 40-minute film once again reproduce the tragic fire scene to the audience and let people witness the power of nature. The film shows how people change their minds, from indifferent to serious face this fire and hope can rely on manpower to solve the mountain fire. And then they become helpless because in the face of the harsh challenge of nature, people have no other choice but to accept. Finally, they have to admit the insignificance and vulnerability of humans to nature. This documentary conveys important information to the audience. Firstly, how should humans deal with all natural disasters? From this film, we can see that many people even the fire station don’t pay enough attention to this wildfire. Therefore, for all humans, we shouldn’t underestimate any natural disaster and must be dealt with seriously. Secondly, when we face these natural disasters, how can we save ourselves. At first, contact relevant departments for the timely rescue. If this doesn’t work, we should find an alternative plan as soon as possible. If we don’t have any other choice, evacuate the dangerous place quickly. This documentary not only let me realize the severity of wildfires, but also informs me that these intensify and frequent natural disasters have a direct relationship with human actions

After watching "Fire in Paradise" I greatly worry about the safety and security of our communities, especially ones more prone to wildfires like our own. My home town is not Santa Barbara, but back home, we have fires every year that are literally in my friends’ backyards; I used to watch snapchat stories of parents using buckets to use their pool water to fend off the fires. One fire even got us evacuated from my high school. However, I never knew anyone whose house burned down and no one lost anything and my high school didn’t burn down. Although the fires are scary, I never saw them as a real threat towards us, I always just believed that they will be resolved, and the firefighters will put them out before it causes any real harm that affects humans. Now, I realize that no one is truly safe from these features of nature. We cannot truly control fires in the sense that I always thought we could. They are much more of a threat to everyone’s safety, and as climate change gets worse, it will be posing an increasingly larger threat to our safety (although it’s hard to believe).
   <br><br>

Seeing the ineffectiveness of Paradise's infrastructure's ability to accommodate everyone needing to evaluate, their emergency and disaster alert system, and disaster evacuation protocols I worry how other cities' disaster plan may be growing more and more ineffective at combatting the more dangerous and more common natural disasters that are possible by worsening climate change. I wonder how well prepared communities are at reacting to a threatening disaster that appears in only a few short hours.
   <br><br>

As climate change causes fires to become worse, I especially worry about my community back home, and seeing how bad fires have been in recent years, I worry that my home and family will be in immediate danger. It is scary to realize that our safety is not just a given, and we must always be prepared to expect the worst in future years. This is not something that is just happening to other people, but it is happening to our own personal lives.

The skies were clouded with a dark grey film, often lighted in an orangeish yellow glow where the sun should have shown brightly, and a layer of ash coated the ground like a sickly snow: that was the apocalyptic reality of NorCal during the fires documented in “Fire in Paradise”. I remember my mom keeping us inside and closing all of the windows. I remember that not being the last time smoke covered our skies. I am glad this documentary was a part of our curriculum because it hits home to many of us who live here in California and saw the effects of this fire or another. 
   <br><br>

The film exemplifies the fast-acting and destructive powers of the climate crisis. We often talk about how there is a tipping point for the Earth when warming will become inevitable as a series of positive feedback loops works our world into a toxic oven. Life is resilient, so we rely on that to further our destruction of this Earth. We can’t keep waiting for that tipping point to actually make changes. The devastating fires in California should be a call to action. We should be supporting and building up the affected communities, and then further building up ourselves in the fight for life in the age of the climate crisis. Fires are not the end of life, but heat can be.

Fire in Paradise was a heartbreaking film to watch. The whole time I was watching, I kept thinking to myself why didn’t they do this or this? As described in this film, there were countless measures and opportunities PG&E, Paradise, 911 operators, firefighters, etc. could have taken to reduce the negative consequences they faced that day. It was shocking to hear that PG&E allowed their electrical towers to be used passed the expiration date they are given in hopes to avoid disasters like this. PG&E also chose not to turn off their power that day, along with 911 operators not being in direct contact with Cal Fire about the severity of the fire, as well as not sending out a mass alert to all residents in Paradise, which led to the loss of life of some. Lastly, a huge detriment was the inability to evacuate the quaint town of Paradise. Their town was simply not built for it. It was unbelievably tragic to watch the evacuation of their town hospital because I can not even imagine the magnitude of fear everyone there must have been facing. As well as hearing first-hand experiences of people having to get out of their cars and run through the fire in hopes to save their own lives. As I sit here wondering about the what-ifs, I also must realize that even though different measures could be taken to help reduce the severity of the fire, I have to realize that climate change had a huge hand in the destruction of Paradise. Firefighters needed the support of helicopters to reach the fire but they couldn’t fly due to the extreme winds they faced, causing embers to fly all over the town of Paradise and take hold. Temperature rise leads to the evaporation of moisture from the ground, drying out the soil, making vegetation much more flammable. All factors Paradise faced because of climate change. The scariest part of this film was the ending quote where the firefighter is asked: “Could it be worse?” “The answer is yes.” We must realize that climate change is very real and no evacuation plan or mass alert warning is going to change the ability mother nature has on us because of our own actions.

To be honest, I didn't know about the recent fires in Australia until this class mentioned it. My bad, I should really read the news more often. Some people might think me not knowing about a fire in Australia is understandable. After all, Australia's super far away from here. It's still a bad reason though. Nowadays, it's so easy for most people to access some form of news, especially if it's local. Yet, I wonder how many Californians are aware of the Camp Fire. Again, I'm ashamed to admit that I had no idea an entire town burned down, despite me being in Southern California at the time. Oops. A lot of people regret not knowing something. The start the movie was especially striking because you can feel the regret of those dealing with the fire. Just watching the start was already frustrating, since I knew that everything was not going to be alright, despite people believing and being told it would be. If only people had known... that the climate crisis was a thing decades ago. Well, people did know, unlike how the inhabitants of Paradise didn't know a fire was going to destroy their town and lives. People chose to ignore climate change because it seemed unpleasant. Many humans don't prevent mistakes or problems, but react to them once they are forced to. Climate skeptics and deniers can choose to deny because they're residence isn't burning down. According to Greta Thunberg, it actually is burning though. They're just refusing to see it because they don't want to see it. When will they see it though? Will they be willing to see it when there’s fire in their face? Maybe not. In the documentary, one person recalled how they, “started freaking out because the fire’s coming at [her] and [she] didn’t want to see it… didn’t want to feel it… like, [she] didn’t want to be there.” She admitted that she, “just kinda wanted to disappear, because [she] couldn’t believe [what] was happening.” It’s not certain that skeptics or deniers or people who don’t want to help solve the climate crisis will accept anthropogenic climate change even if a fire is burning their house down. After all, who can persuade them that the fire was absolutely caused by climate change, not PG&E? It’s also pretty normal for someone to not want to see their imminent demise. Besides, it’ll be too late for them to react once a fire’s surrounding them.
   <br><br>
I can google the Camp Fire and immediately learn about it. Yet, I learned about it a year after. How was the me in 2018 supposed to know that a town was burning down? I also didn’t know about a tornado in Santa Barbara until I received an alert on my phone about a tornado near my city, which is also literally unheard of. Even if information is available, there’s no guarantee that people will see it, know it, or remember it, especially if they don’t consider the information important. There’s so much to pay attention to, and even with the automatic preference filtering online, people still can’t pay attention to everything important, especially if it doesn’t seem to directly affect them. A fire a continent away seems less important than a fire 500 miles away from your home, and a fire in your face is much more dangerous. Even if you see fire, you might not realize how dire the situation is, which is what happened in the Camp Fire, as shown in the documentary. Some people heard the alerts, but didn’t evacuate. That was frustrating to me. I’d imagine that most people felt similar: why wouldn’t you flee from the deadliest wildfire in California? I was most frustrated by how you could opt out of receiving alerts. As said in the documentary, people expect to be notified. If you opt out or don’t sign up though, you won’t be notified, but you’ll probably still be expected to be notified because it’s a dangerous situation. 
   <br><br>

During the fire, nobody wanted to delay notifying people. Alerts were sent out, but they were sent to “only those who had signed up,” despite knowing that “sign-ups were not where they needed to be.” Plans to increase sign-ups in 2019 were too late. I don’t understand why you wouldn’t sign up for an alert like that, but I also kind of do. Maybe people didn’t notice or expected that they’d be automatically notified if the situation got that serious. Maybe signing up was too much of a hassle. Maybe they forgot. I’m just disappointed that, somehow, people weren’t alerted despite their town burning down around them. I’m also disappointed that people haven’t been alerted to climate change despite it happening right in front of them and all around them. Climate change isn’t as obvious as a fire burning your house, but it’s just as serious and even more dangerous because of how hard to notice it is for the average human. It should be mandatory for people to be alerted about serious issues, but even something that almost everyone would agree on is complicated. How serious is serious? It depends. If it is serious, how serious is it? It’s good to be prepared, but how much preparation counts as being prepared? A policeman said that the plan was successful. If Paradise burned down, how successful is that? Paradise was actually a really prepared place, especially since fires were not unprecedented. The town of Paradise burnt down, but there’s no one specific to blame, besides maybe PG&E. The police and fire department should have prepared more in hindsight, but the plan seemed to be pretty good at the time because a fire that “went seven-and-a-miles in an hour and a half” was unrealistic to plan for. It’s terrifying to think about, but someday, overpreparing might be the same as being unprepared. Prevention and reacting with solutions might not be enough or even possible because climate change has already arrived.

“Fire in Paradise” was a really eye opening film because it puts climate change in a different but familiar perspective. When you see and entire film made because of the importance and danger of how severe climate change is affecting an area you're so familiar with is crazy. You never think that such severe and drastic weather patterns are going to happen to you or places you know well. It was extremely heartbreaking watching this and all of the families that had to deal with this catastrophic event. Before this film and this class in general I used to live in an area extremely prone to wildfire and to me, it just made sense that when it gets hot trees might get hot so maybe wildfires were just that naturally frequent. This film also alerted me to how even though we talk about climate change as something is soon to come in the future, its not. It may be prone to get worse in the future but it has definitely already started and we need to start trying to deal with it as a faster rate because we’re already late to the beginning of climate change. Now I'm aware that a lot of devastating large wildfires are due to rapidly progressing climate change.

<p>
This film does a great job in both bringing awareness to climate change and presenting solutions to avoid events like these.
    <br><br>

It brings awareness by highlighting how small changes in the earth's temperature can disproportionately wreck havoc on humans. The facts it presents are simple: since we've begun warming up the planet, fire season has gotten longer due to decreased humidity and increased winds. The decreased humidity increases the odds of combustibility of plants. The increased winds makes power structures more prone to collapsing and igniting said combustible plant matter. In addition the increased winds cause fires to spread at a faster rate. This all adds up to more frequent and powerful fires that directly threaten our way of life.
    <br><br>

The biggest issue I see with presenting climate change to individuals is that it is often causes a state of paralysis as the issue appears to them as too dire to address. Here, some solutions are proposed: have clear evacuation routes, communication systems and turn off power in times of high wind. Although this does not address the aggravating factor of temperature rise, it still gives people a sense of alarm and forces them to confront the reality of climate change. I hope this video especially reaches those who live in this type of area who can further prepare themselves for scenarios like this.




</p><hr>



<p>
In my opinion,  “Fire in Paradise” didn’t seem to tell me much about climate change. Yes, the combination of the faulty PG&E line with the dry weather and high winds may have all played a role in contributing to the fast-spreading fire, but it may not necessarily be climate change all at fault. A wildfire could have been possible any other year, but because of the higher human population/occupation and thus higher threats of unintentional fire starting, there is a higher chance of wildfires occurring. In the video, professor Hiltner mentions that four of the five largest wildfires in California’s history happened in the last decade. However, the fires that have been occurring in recent years have been due to human actions such as campfires, fireworks, sparked metal, and power lines. To be fair, Professor Ken does briefly address the relevance of the documentary with the current issue of climate change, but I still do not necessarily believe that climate change is at fault for all the fires in recent years–rather, it is the negligence of humans. 

    <br><br>

Do not get me wrong, I do believe that the drier climate of California helps to fuel and spread the fire at faster rates, however, it may just be a regional climate that is simply just a part of where we are situated geographically. It could also be the fact that California is becoming more and more populated, giving rise to more chances for humans to start a fire. I am not completely against the stance that global warming is to blame here for the influx of California wildfires in recent years, however, I would like a further explanation with more evidence before we can safely say that these fires are because of climate change.

    <br><br>

With that aside, I found “Fire in Paradise” to be very informative and crucial for future preparation in the event that another wildfire was to strike California. With fire hazards becoming more frequent, we must all be cautious, mindful, and prepared if we were to be stuck in such a situation. This means that companies should make sure that their equipment is functional and updated, campfires are attended, cigarettes are snuffed out, and any other potential things that could initiate a fire is being accounted for. To prepare, towns such as Paradise should make sure to have an evacuation plan and local forces should have a way to inform the public in case of a fire. What happened in Paradise was horrific and devastating, but it makes me wonder if it could have been avoided. If the Thomas fire happened in Santa Barbara in the past, then who knows what can happen in the future? After watching the film, I was made more aware of the possibility of such an event happening to just about anyone. If climate change really is to blame for all the wildfires, then there should be no denying that it affects us here at home because it’s already in our backyard.

After I watched the film "Fire in Paradise", I thought a lot. We must know that the United States is a highly developed country, but such a modern country has failed to prevent fires from taking the lives of 85 people. I express my sorrow for these people who have passed away. I understand that large fires are difficult to resolve by manpower, but the government cannot do nothing because the fires are difficult to resolve. They must at least reduce the probability of fires. Climate change and some human factors may increase the probability of fires. The film describes the fire and its serious consequences. Natural disasters are inevitable, but if human activities increase the probability of disasters, we have to think about how to stop it.If the power company's equipment is in disrepair for years, the government should probably take steps to get these companies to consider more than just their money.

The consequences of climate crisis are serious. The documentary, “Fire in Paradise”, shows one of the consequences of the climate crisis. Climate crisis truly affects everyone, and no one could escape from the catastrophic influences. Before watching this video, many people might think it is far away from them. For most Americans, they might think this is a pretty far away things for them. However, regardless where your home is, the climate crisis will still have huge impacts on you. The wildfire happens around the world, not only in California. Many people and wild animals lost their lives because of the fire.The reason for the ignorance of the climate crisis might be they don’t want to believe that is truth. We must acknowledge the fact that climate crisis is around us, we must take actions. When I saw the picture that some koalas are dead and lost their homes, I felt heart broken. I desire to change my life style deep in my heart to save the lives of both animals and us.

"Fire in Paradise" does a good job in telling a powerful survival story through first-hand footage of the catastrophe and cell-phone videos. The use of social media footage and animated maps allows the audience to be guided throughout the film without confusion.  The anecdotes also adds to the movie's experience in which they bring forth the weight in emotion bared upon the casualties' voices.  The documentary's shift of the narration connects the increase of wildfires to climate change due to long drought and dry summers. It is deeply saddening to see family's being evacuated from their homes, especially the patients from the hospital. Its emotional appeals helps emphasize that climate crisis is more than just statistics, but a growing global issue. This film has allowed to realize the true terror of disasters and its long term effect. As climate change continues to impact the world today, it is never too late for a change.

Fire in Paradise did a great job at showing us what it was like to live through a fire and the damage it causes. Most of the people who died in the fire were 65 and older. They are often times forgotten when people are fearing for their own lives and they are not as well connected to know the severity of the fire. Many of them are also unable to move without assistance. The people in the film did a great job in putting everything into perspective and the stress that they endured. Something that really got to me was when the dispatcher was on the phone with the dying woman and he couldn’t do anything to help her but to listen. It was really upsetting how not enough was done to protect the people living in Paradise. If they had let people know to evacuate a lot of lives could’ve been saved, but they do say that there was only one person in charge of getting the message out. The reality is that fires are not uncommon in California and yet people still do not have plans put in place to limit the amount of people harmed. I think we need to become better prepared to live through these disasters especially if people are unwilling to take climate change seriously, because this is where we are headed if we do not take action soon!

It was depressing watching this film and I got very emotional hearing the stories of the people affected by the fires. It is different when you just hear the numbers or data of the event that occurred versus putting a face to a story because although you acknowledge the event that happened, it hits different when you see people attached to the story. The film picks a perfect example of events that are occurring due to the result of climate change and it does not beat around the bush to figure out why it happened: they explicitly state the fire's intensity is blamed to our burning of fossil fuels leading to climate change and it is only going to get worse as we continue to burn more. It's sad that a fire that was small turned into something huge that forced thousands of people to flee their homes because of the great destruction that swept their town. Imagine not being able to return to a place that held so many memories because it had been burnt down to the ground. What frustrates me and made me sad was that the people had not been well-informed and should have been evacuated right away because of the lives that were lost. It is irritating to see climate change occurring right in front of our eyes yet no adequate effort has been put forth by the United States to stop it. Like what are we waiting for? Do we need something more catastrophic than this event to show that Climate Change is a real deal and not just a ploy being used by climate scientists? This is an extremely important issue and we need to take it more seriously because it is only going to get worse.

The film portrayed everything that I thought it must be like to live in an area by fires and where fires occur. The flames from videos taken in the fire were honestly terrifying. What upset me the most was that the fire could have been prevented if the electric company had only updated their systems. It is upsetting that this is always the same fight. Big corps. vs. climate crisis. With the other film, Before the Flood, we also learned how oil companies and other big corps. are the ones that are deniers and try to avoid changing their old machinery/customs to newer/renewable resources. The same fight, what I see is money vs. our planet and unfortunately I think money is winning. One of the men interviewed stated if the company were a person they would already be in prison, but you can't put a company in prison. Honestly, why is there no regulations?, why is no one enforcing anything?  Why isn't the government enforcing these regulations for companies? Then it just goes back to what we know, boomers don't believe in climate change and boomers run the nation.

While watching this film I could not help but feel absolutely devastated. As one who lives in California, it hits quite close to home. The start is the film is quite shocking that all because the electrical company decided not to turn off the power lines the fire had started as a result of the powerful winds. The individual families whose lives were impacted such as the guy with the pumpkin farm show that this is something that affects real people and by showing these families makes this feel so much more real and should make us take action. This film does a great job embodying the CampFire and why it was so catastrophic. Even though I live in California and aware of the fires this film makes it very clear to me how much more this really is. This is not just people losing their homes and belongings but their lives and their irreplaceable possessions resulting in their lifestyle and wellness being compromised. This film does a wonderful job providing real interviews of people who were there at the fires while showing videos of the fires to show how serious this was and provide an insight for those who were not there.

Watching Fire in Paradise gave me a horrible sense of panic and dread regarding where we are with the climate crisis and where we could be headed. I began watching the film with a friend, and closer to the beginning he commented that it seemed like sensational journalism (too dramatic). After we kept watching he corrected himself - there is no way to report this without drama; the event itself feels like it was out of a horror movie. I also argued that even if this film mostly centers around human stories of fear and anxiety rather than facts and data, this is what people need to see and here. It isn't until we actually see people trapped in their homes and cars about to burn to death that we can fully fathom the state our planet is currently in. I live in Marin county in Northern California, and my house is on a windy road surrounded by trees. Ever since the Camp fire and the other California fires that happened last year I have been scared of the same thing happening in my town. What happened in Paradise just shows how crucial it is to not only have an evacuation plan but also prepare for blocked roads, miscommunication with the police department, lack of direction, and unreliable rescue plans. One of the officers in the film said that the best person to direct your evacuation is "you." I think this was a way for him to take some of the heat off of the PD, and I also don't agree - if everyone is going crazy trying to save themselves with a universal organized plan, there are so many moving variables to complicate matters. But at the same time, this film proved you can't really rely upon authorities in the face of natural disasters such as this, and so maybe it is smart to have a personal plan of action.

Since I have lived in california all my life, hearing about wildfires is not uncommon. When I heard about the fire in Paradise, I was applying for colleges. I had heard about a large fire in Northern California, but I did not realize the severity of it until the University of California extended the application deadline. After that I knew the fire had to be devastating. I had looked into it and seen all the statistics: most destructive fire in california history, at least 85 civilian fatalities, 18,804 structures destroyed, and 153,336 acres affected. Reading these statistics did not have the same effect as watching “Fire in Paradise.” I remember reading this and being in awe. I was blown back by the fact that a fire this large could happen in November, not in a summer month, in the fall/ winter. Every summer (in my town) we normalized the fires in our mountains and the first few weeks of school being cancelled because the fires left the air quality so bad that it was a hazard to even walk on our campus. The people who lived at the bottom of the mountain in our city were evacuated at least three times every summer and by now it was just expected. It’s frightening to think that our fires that we define as “small” could easily be just as big as the paradise fire. 
    <br><br>

When I watched “Fire in Paradise” I finally put faces to the statistics: how many people were evacuated, how rapidly the fire was spreading, and how many buildings were destroyed. It made everything I read about this fire real. The statistics were unbearable. The video footage in this episode made it so much easier to see just how much climate change is actually affecting our day to day lives. It is hard to dismiss the argument that climate change is real when it contributes to destroying whole communities within a matter of hours. To even imagine waking up one day having everything and then a few hours later knowing that everything you woke up with was demolished in a fire is just devastating. The fact that 50,000 people managed to escape is insane because the entire town was on fire. This one fire destroyed the lives of everyone in that community and the fire itself could have been avoided if PG&E had bothered to fix their faulty equipment. In my opinion, this company was grossly negligent and knowing that they denied that they were responsible for this fire made me furious. It was hard to watch this and see the emotion of the 911 dispatchers, the firefighters, and especially the civilians who lost family members in the fire and not be furious at the company who caused all this chaos. However, I was more frustrated with our society because we contributed to this disaster without even realizing it by contributing to climate change and leaving these towns with conditions that made them vulnerable to long lasting, destructive fires.

The wildfire in California is becomming common. The film " Fire in Paradise" is depressive and heart-attacking. Climate changes and global warming play a role of causing the wild fire. Human actions should be responsible for such disaster. Humans used to set up fire to brighten on the road of exploration and culture, but now we have to spend extra efforts and money to put off the fire that threatens the public facilities and health. The film really shows what was going on during the wildfire. While we rely on the nature to benefit us, we should also care more about what is happening in the nature.

Not gonna lie I choked on my ramen when you said the thing about Australia. Seeing the raw footage taken by victims of the fire is one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen in a documentary. These candid moments of people fleeing for their lives from fiery destruction is difficult to watch and seems extremely apocalyptic. I can't imagine the level of destruction happening in a fire that is simply so so much larger than this one. Not having grown up with fires on the east coast, I'm unaccustomed to this level of danger surrounding my home. Every winter, the sea changes the beaches on the coast of Massachusetts, many of them disappearing entirely. This saddens me greatly. However, I'd take it a thousand times over watching my home burning up. Climate change has a sick sense of humor. Not only do the poorest half of the world's population suffer the most from climate change, but the most climate conscious state of the United States must take the worst hits as well.

"Fire in Paradise" was a hard film to watch as you see family homes burning, cars abandoned and caught on fire,  and hearing the sad stories of some of the survivors. At the beginning of the film, I felt anger towards the lack of communication between the firefighters of the counties and Cal Fire and the police department of Paradise; because Paradise residents had such a short window to evacuate their homes- leaving the town to panic and caught in the middle of the fire. Plus, nurses and doctors having to evacuate patients, some who had to carry their own IV bags and others coming out of surgery. Moreover, the town of Paradise had a town evacuation plan with a trial run in 2008, which the county grand jury warned of the town roads to be "serious capacity limitations" yet they did not give the funds necessary to expand the road. If the roads were expanded then most likely the town wouldn't have suffered the way it did. 
    <br><br>

It was devastating to hear the stories of the survivors interviewed; like a wife scared that she will not live to see her husband or kids again, and a daughter leaving her mother in their home to find out she died in the fire, and a granddaughter losing her grandfather with a water hose in his hands. I think, these interviews from survivors and authorities, the film content caught from the towns folk and the scientific facts to support the story; made this film a success. It wasn't like the other films about the climate crisis this one was more personal that allowed us to connect with the people affected. I actually teared up when hearing their stories. But I just find it sad that there are people in denial about the climate crisis out in the world, and I don't think they will believe it until they experience a natural disaster the way many people around the world already have. The climate crisis is real. It's happening right now, with these crazy wildfires, floods, etc.

Throughout the documentary, I could hear just how desperate the civilians were to escape the fire and to see the light of day. This incident gives the rest of California good reason to come up with escape routes in case of a fire anywhere near as destructive as the one that blew through Paradise. With greenhouse gas emissions constantly rising, we can expect to see even more of these devastating fires ignited in dry areas around California. The one positive thing I can make out of this horrific event is that because of fires like this that have been happening so frequently, people are beginning to accept the notion that anthropogenic global warming is a real thing, and that we are just beginning to experience the consequences now. I hope that Californians will come together and begin to bring change throughout the state whether that is by voting or protesting, or both. Hopefully, this includes us going wind and/or solar-powered in the next couple of years as well in order to avoid a further increase in temperature change along the coast. This would then decrease the likelihood of major fires occurring. The fires in Australia Ken had mentioned should be a true wakening call to the entire world and in particular those who believe that anthropogenic global warming doesn’t exist. The Australian wildfires are significantly bigger than anything we’ve seen in California, and definitely do not pose as normal throughout Australia. Even someone who does know much about climate change will know that these huge fires are being fueled by something other than natural CO2 emissions. We are just starting to see the effects of greenhouse gas emitted by Ken’s generation. Things could get much worse, and fast.

The documentary "Fire in Paradise" was deeply saddening and difficult to watch. Fires have become a bigger issue in CA within the past years, for UCSB students it hits close to home. This film reminded me of the Thomas Fire that occurred two years ago. It was difficult not to point fingers at who was to blame for the lack of communication that occurred with the citizens of Paradise in the film. It was crazy to see how many civilians were worried about the fire they saw but were told they were in no danger until it was almost too late. It taught me that although we heavily really on authorities to keep us safe, things don't always play out the way they are expected. I know dispatchers did not know about the situation but it was absurd that the fire could be easily see yet authorities in Paradise did not take the time to check for themselves and instead were waiting to be told how the fire was growing and in what direction. This should be a lesson to everyone. The fire in Paradise could have has a smoother evacuation if people were told when the fire was already visible. The police officer that spoke about how our safety is really in our hands put a lot of things in perspective. When the Thomas Fire occurred and air quality was terrible at UCSB, no one told students what to do. Instead we were told everything was fine when clearly everything was not fine. I left Santa Barbara before students were told they could leave because I was wanted to be proactive about my safety and felt that it was not okay for us to be living under those circumstances. This film taught me to take everything that occurs around us seriously because the natural disasters are unpredictable and our safety is up to us.

The chilling documentary not only antithesizes the severity of the climate crisis, but serves as a horrifying reminder of the future we are facing. Year after year, California wildfires are getting larger, burning hotter, spreading faster, and doing more damage. I learned at an early age that, in order to have an effective fire in the wood stove, you need three things, fuel, kindling, and a spark. Living in California, we have no shortage of trees, especially in the rural Northern part of the state, where it seems most fires occur. These trees have served as fuel for fires for milenia, but the natural fires that would come through every once in a while were small and not all that destructive. Nonetheless, trees meet that first criteria. While California’s mismanagement of its forests has certainly not assist the primary cause for these explosive fires is drought. Not only does drought dry out trees, making them more flammable, but it also effectively cripples trees’ abilities to fight off pests, like bark beetles and fungi, that can easily kill trees, drastically increasing flammability. So what happens when you mix wide swaths of dense forest with drought? You get huge dry forests, hundreds of thousands of acres of trees ready to ignite at the slightest hint of a spark. At this point it is nearly impossible to deny the causal relationship between carbon emissions and a warmer climate, but cars, the primary way most people emit a majority of their carbon footprint, pose another, less obvious danger. If a trailer hitch or any other part of a car or truck drags on the ground, it is fairly easy to create a spark. Multiply that small risk of something dragging by the number of cars on the road in California, about 14.5 million as of 2016, you get a much greater probability of a spark happening. In a sense, the dry forest is a bomb waiting to explode, and the world we live in is very likely to generate man-made sparks. It sounds like a recipe for disaster right? Well, I prefer to call it a Monday in California.

This film had a huge impact on myself and I’m sure many others because of the personal perspectives it displayed. By interviewing real people and showing real feelings, I felt the pain of the victims and yearned for a solution to climate change and its devastating results. The people featured either lost loved ones or fought for their lives to make sure they could be with their loved ones again. There were so many dramatic images of the chaos, it felt as though I myself was consumed by the fire. The few scenes about the hospital evacuation were heart wrenching as we watched patients holding their own IV bags attempt to escape the flames. 
    <br><br>

Besides the saddening stories and terrifying visuals, a lot of the film did discuss why the fire happened and why it was not prevented or handled particularly well. I empathized with officials because they were convinced that they did have a plan for evacuation, and the errors they may have noticed before the incident and tried to correct were just too expensive and unrealistic to execute. Widening the roads is a huge cost and paying that price on the off chance that maybe there is a big enough wildfire in this small town to require wider roads for evacuation is a tough argument to make to the government. I do think there were enough incidents leading up to the campfire that should have made an extremely efficient evacuation plan for the whole town an urgent issue that needed a solution immediately. The communication method was a complete disaster. Half of the town had not signed up for the service they used and therefore the majority of people were not even ordered to evacuate. Overall, it was a chaotic situation that outpaced the resources. Climate change has intensified wildfires and it is becoming crucial for entire populations to have thorough and dependable plans for evacuation, expecting fires to spread fast and far.

This film "Fire in Paradise" shows the difficulty of dealing with the effects of the climate crisis. Humanity will put out fires, fortify our coastal cities and plant what can grow. This will be a period of saving what we have left rather than continuing to grow and create as humanity has done for the last 200,000 years. This time will not be pleasant as thousands of firefighters will sacrifice their lives to put out fires that would have been victimless if preventable actions were taken. This film does an excellent job showing the horrors the natural world can unleash on a species once thought to have conquered the natural world. Just as the dinosaurs, the apex predators of their time fell to the disasters the earth unleashed on them, we too can fall victim to the environment of our own making. This class insights fear within its student and this fear is needed to stop what has already gone on for too long. I do not wish to bestow the weight of our challenges onto the backs of firefighters, engineers, and other first responders when disaster hits; but feel it better to address these problems now, together as a species, to let the legacy of humanity to live on.

I believe movies like this are essential to people, especially of older generations, to understand the threat climate change is posing to us. They show is the real life consequences of our damage, and how these consequences are already affecting people’s day-to-day lives. A lot of older people have lived through events such as hurricane Katrina, wars, 9/11, etc. so they understand tragedy and are empathetic. By seeing people lose their belongings, their homes, their families and their own lives, I believe we can make a larger audience connect to the issue and act on it. If saving the planet for the planet’s sake isn’t enough, then maybe saving it for the people could be.

I agree with your comment that the Fire in Paradise shows the real life consequences to people's lives. I feel like a lot of the climate crises articles and content usually take the statistical/numbers perspective in hopes to convince people through the use of logos. However, I think they often turn a blind eye to pathos, and forget how powerful human emotion is. 
    <br><br>

Therefore, with a film like Fire in Paradise, it gives us a holistic review of what happened. It includes the statistics, but also includes the very real consequences we must face.
    <br><br>

Hopefully, more films like this one can become mainstream and inform the general public of not only the short term consequences of climate change, but also the long term.

This was an incredible film to watch. I never so vividly would have imagined a fire such as this one. I realized how traumatizing that experience is, being stuck in a fire of that magnitude. What astonishes me the most is the way it began. How incredible are humans to refuse to take precautions. I have noticed how many incidents could have been prevented if cautionary measures were to have been taken. The situation was definitely underestimated from the start, something very similar that is occurring with the climate crisis, too much underestimating is occurring. I understand how nothing runs perfectly when such dangers are presented but I find it crazy how messy the situation was. The film stated how Cal Fire normally notifies Paradise Police with information but didn't do so this time. Being in there I can only imagine the frenzy and anxiety of how to proceed and go about the situation after underestimating it so horribly, but I would think their communication would have been way better since it is so dire for order and safety. I guess it is easier to look back now and say this should have been done but I am glad the film brings up these questions. The climate crisis will only continue to worsen and magnify incidents. Remembering that scene at the hospital covered in dark black and red skies send me shivers down my spine.

After watching the documentary “Fire in Paradise,” I have realized something: it is important to have an evacuation plan and to have a reliable method to send emergency messages to the residents. If they could have a more effective plan of evacuation, it is reasonable to believe that more people could escape from the town, and if everyone in Paradise could receive a message sending from local government about what is actually happening, they would start to pack stuff and start to evacuate instead of making phone calls and staying at home. Also, from the view of climate change, the rising temperature of California has increased the frequency and severity of wildfire, which we should all pay attention to and try to resolve the crisis.

I agree with you, it is very important to have a community evacuation plan. I also think that Paradise was not expecting a fire this large in a million years. This town was also very conservative before and the majority did not believe in climate change. The only positive thing we can take away from this horrific event is the fact that these people, as well as the other outside the event who witnessed it on T.V., are now aware of global warming and its effects on the climate. We should all use this disaster as a warning. We need to prepare for things like this because people are only continuing to emit greenhouse gases every day. Until we do something about reducing all of our carbon footprints, we have to be prepared for the worse. This means creating evacuation plans, having extra resources on hand, and the ability to remain in contact with people in case phones are of no use (Walkie Talkies).

After watching 'Fire in Paradise' I was left in such a deep shock that I had to rewatch the entire film again. Having grown up in Dubai, a city where agriculture and forests are a very bare minimum, I had never had the trouble of worrying about a forest fire. I moved to the US two years back and during that time I have had the unfortunate opportunity of being worried about two forest fires. However, when I watched 'Film in Paradise' I came to realize that my fear was very much amplified and that true fear lies in the thought of your whole city being completely destroyed by a wildfire. This was a very tough film to watch as throughout, I kept on putting myself in the people affected position and it really stirred me. I would be beyond devastated to have had my grandfather's house destroyed and for him to lose his life in the process. This havoc deserves to be broadcasted and widely publicized as PG&E needs to take accountability for the mayhem they created. 

    <br><br>

Interestingly, I recently read a Wallstreet Journal article that talked about how PG&E was going bankrupt and this all stemmed from the incident that occurred in the film. My first thoughts were karma. However, the more I thought about it the more I realized that this still doesn't amend to the damages they have caused. It is beyond corporate bureaucracy and justice needs to be rightly served. As the film mentioned several times, if this was a person and not a corporation, that person would be behind bars. Now although this incident may seem independent of the climate crisis. It really isn't. This just exemplifies how there are so many corporate giants who participate in unethical business procedures that heavily damages the environment and get away with it! It is time we stand up against this unscrupulous corporate BS!

I was really surprised that, aside from the one climate scientist who briefly commented on how climate changes is prolonging these fire seasons and escalating possible destruction, all of the people who described how the environment has been changing in the film did not directly express the connection between human-casued climate change and the fire that occurred. Firefighters and town officials were clearly noting how dryness, rising temperatures and other factors that led to this tragedy are new developments in the environment. They were extremely aware of the changes that have happened in the last few years but not one person tied that in to the climate crisis or why this is happening.  I don't know why this is, but imagine that perhaps the people who produced this documentary wanted to refrain from making so obvious of a "political statement," or anything that would polarize viewers or keep people from watching the film. Whatever, the reason was, the film and any other is a choice, with a message curated by its producers. It is disappointing to think how a film that touches so deeply and directly on this issue and such a devastating event does not strongly attempt to spread the message of the climate crisis, when the footage and situation shown is so compelling and invokes so much emotion. Especially when considering that this could be because of a conscious decision to draw more viewers or avoid seeming too political.

“Fire in Paradise” made me feel a heartbreak and loss that I did not expect. Seeing people recall the emotions they felt within less than a few hour time span, and recall people that they lost in the Campfire genuinely made my heart sink. Most surprising to me is how an entire town was desolated in less than four hours. 50,000 people evacuated, 83 people's lives lost, and thousands of homes down to ash in this time. It just baffles me how quickly everything happened and how no one in the town of Paradise knew what was going on, they were just rushed out as they saw flames engulfing their home without explanation. I felt their confusion in the film. I also reflected where I was during the time of the Campfire. Only three hours away, I was probably getting ready for school in the early morning and going about my day. I remember at some point hearing about the Campfire on the news or maybe I read it on Twitter, but it never crossed my mind that it was a fire of this capacity. I never knew even before this film that it was this devastating, in terms of how fast it moved after ignition. Saying this I almost feel ignorant. How did I not know the extent of the most devastating natural disaster in 2018, and California’s deadliest and destructive fire in history? It was because it didn’t happen to me. I was distant and removed from the incident. I feel like that is how most of the climate crisis today is received. Many Americans specifically have not experienced the effects of climate change in their own personal lives, so they feel removed from the situation and even if they know it exists, they feel like they can get away with not addressing it for the time being. This thought instills a different kind of fear in me that cannot be explained. It is almost like I know that change will not happen until it hits people in the face, but once it does it will be catastrophic and and at irreversible costs. The film made me fearful for the future, and fearful at thoughts of natural disasters on a greater scale. Yet it also moved me to try and continue to educate myself and do as much as I can for myself and others to hopefully moderate disaster in the future.

Films like this are necessary because it allows its viewers, who may once have been unsympathetic to the issue of climate change, to see the devastating impacts the wildfire has on individual lives. People often need to hear these kinds of stories so they understand the severity of the situation and how devastating the consequences can be. They realize that it is more than possible that one day, their own community could be engulfed in flames because of the drastic changes in the climate caused by human actions. In many cases, this could help prompt people to taking action against climate change, either through voting, or personal lifestyle changes like becoming vegan. This film was very heartbreaking to me, and I hope that some good can come out of it by motivating others to take action. It was also frightening in the sense that this could one day become a devastating reality all over the globe and on a regular basis. The documentary was not centered in the climate crisis, but wildfires are certainly one of the many symptoms of climate change, which is also why this film is quite terrifying and why it should motivate others to take action regarding the issue of climate change. No one wants to experience what the people in this film went through and they shouldn't have to.

People from indifferent and absent-minded to face it seriously (hope that they can rely on manpower to solve this wildfire), to powerlessness (facing the harsh challenges of nature, people have no other choice but to accept it), pray for God for blessing, and finally have to admit Human beings are small and fragile (all fled, in order to survive). From this movie, we can clearly see that many people (even the fire alarm center) have insufficient prejudgment about the fire hazards, perfunctory, and finally defeated by the facts. Therefore, any natural disaster cannot be underestimated and must be dealt with seriously.
    <br><br>

In the movie, some people wait and doing nothing; some people flee quickly; some people kneel and pray ... all these actions are "normal areas." But the question is, how do people adjust their mindsets next? Is it forward or backward? Give up hope or fight hard? This is important. Because at this moment, "the change of mindset" may influence one's future. In the film, rescuers and trapped people unanimously gave the four words "positive face". It is believed that this was not a publicity slogan, but the most authentic voice in people's hearts at that moment.

After watching "Fire in Paradise," I can't possibly begin to fathom the sheer emotions, distress, and panic that swept over the city of Paradise over the course of only a few hours. My only point of comparison, the Thomas Fire, was a catastrophe I was fortunate enough to never have experienced firsthand, but I have talked to many upperclassmen that described the smoke that engulfed Goleta, the masks they had to wear just to be able to breathe properly, and the astonishing fact that it was severe enough of a concern for UCSB to cancel finals entirely and urge students to evacuate. While I can't imagine what it was like to be in the presence of a wildfire of that magnitude, I can't help but think that I am bound to witness one much more widespread and devastating than the Thomas Fire was, considering the recency of the Camp Fire and the unbelievable damage it wreaked. It's very easy for me to feel helpless when thinking about wildfires that will happen in the coming years near Goleta and the surrounding area because I simply have no say in it. Whether I like it or not, climate change worsens wildfires by providing the perfect conditions for it to flourish: later and smaller amounts of rainfall leading to drought, warmer months, and faster winds that merely need a tiny source of ignition to exponentially magnify into hell on Earth. I cannot mitigate the threat of wildfires near UCSB whatsoever, and neither can my peers. The only saving grace comes from being aware of the looming threat since I can devise a somewhat effective evacuation plan and purchase useful supplies well before any sort of fire crops up near me.

Seeing the interviews of people whose lives were directly affected by the Camp Fire from all walks of life, from the nurse helping to evacuate an entire hospital and herself at the same time to the firefighters trying to help as tirelessly worked to aid as many people as they physically could, was heartbreaking but also extremely eye-opening, especially taking into account the personal videos they took of their experiences on the unfortunate morning of November 8th. The lack of up-to-date information from law enforcement and firefighters, while frustrating to see, was also justified given the difficult circumstances they were forced to deal with. I can't imagine the sheer chaos and pandemonium that the wildfire sowed into virtually every native of Paradise, seeing the town they and their family grew up in disintegrating before their very eyes in a matter of a single morning, a disaster they could only run from if they even had a way of doing so. Hearing the 911 call involving the lady and 2 others trapped in a windowless room in their burning home was really saddening, and I completely understand why the dispatcher stayed on the line with her the whole time, despite being unable to promise her any immediate, tangible way to help her and the others successfully escape. Putting myself in the shoes of the daughter who herself realized the pressing urgency of the wildfire eating up her town but her mother being of the mindset that things weren't really that bad, I'm not sure how I would cope with the confusing entanglement of emotions that would arise while evacuating and after-the-fact, particularly after hearing that she didn't make it. The only thing I can be certain of in that situation is how I would blame myself for not begging and pleading with her more because I was realistically her only way out; I can't say whether I would ever entirely get over that guilt. I honestly hope that I will never have to be placed in that dire of a situation alongside my loved ones, as I can already imagine the rippling effects an event like this would have on our lives forever.

I was thoroughly shocked when the film said that the fire spread in a matter of four hours. It made me think about how I would react if all of a sudden my whole life got torn apart and I had a matter of hours to escape. It is a very hard situation to picture. I was raised by a Forest Service fire chief and a Forester so I have a little bit of knowledge regarding fire behavior, and this fire's behavior was insane, even considering the dry terrain and the wind that was present.
    <br><br>
I grew up in El Dorado County and a few years ago we had the King Fire. It tore through hundreds of thousands of acres of Forest Service land. The King Fire was an arson fire and the man is in prison for what he did. The people at PG&E who "claim" that they were not knowingly being negligent should be held accountable. Whether it was known or not, they destroyed an entire town and killed many people. It frustrates me that the one King Fire arsonist is in jail but the entire company of arsonists that caused the Camp Fire are not. Or at least not to the same extent. Just like how the United States needs to take responsibility for its contribution to the climate crisis, PG&E needs to accept responsibility for the destruction they caused.
    <br><br>
It also upset me deeply when that woman was talking about how she left her mom there to die. This is unrelated to the climate crisis but I love my mom and I would risk my life for her in a heartbeat. It made me so mad that that woman just left her mom there when she was being stubborn. I would've carried my mom out.

“Fire In Paradise” was an extremely informative film and it really opened my eyes to the damage that is done when a wildfire spreads. While for the last few years I’ve heard of the fires that have terrorized California, I never really understood what was happening. To be frank, “Fire In Paradise” was absolutely terrifying. The misconnection between enforcement and the dire reality that follows a disaster such as a fire highlighted the idea that no matter how much humanity may plan, at times mother nature will simply outmatch them. The real-life anecdotes from survivors of the fire added to the sense of the gravity of the situation. For while I sat here safely in front of my computer watching this documentary from months ago, the interviews really brought emotion and caused me to tear up while watching the film. The documentary just did an overall great job of showing what happened, why it happened, and what could have been different.
     <br><br>
An interesting point that I got out of the documentary was PG&E’s negligence of the situation and the idea that if PG&E was a person they would currently be incarcerated. I completely agree with this idea as it seems to be natural, in a very disturbing way, that a giant corporation will follow the mantra, “If it’s not broke don’t fix it”. That being said, I found “Fire In Paradise” to be a really well-made film that definitely opened up my eyes to the damage that climate change is doing to wildfires and how it is empowering them and causing them to become thousand-year monsters that happen every year.

Learning from different kinds of news, fire is always a word that seemed familiar for me. In my mind, fire is a kind “easy-escape” issue that does not need much attention. However, at the beginning of the movie, it describes the fire specifically and how people escape from the horrible fire. I can’t imagine how hard for those doctors and nurses to help their patients get out of the fire places. Instead of only describing, the movie makes comments at the same time in order to help audiences to understand more clearly. 
       <br><br>
Due to the climate changes caused by nature or human, climate crisis has caused millions of people or animal lose their homes or even their lives, and it is important for us to admit that climate problem need to be treated more seriously in order to avoid more “catastrophes.” From my perspective, global warming is always the most key reason for those crisis because under the increasing temperature and dry atmosphere, it would be much easier to cause a horrible fire crisis. In this way, it is important to slow the carbon dioxide emission rate as soon as we can.

The film Fire in Paradise was very emotional. It was heartbreaking hearing the stories of lives lost within the fire, as well as all the fear and trauma that occurred during the evacuation. At the same time, seeing the effects of the fire on an emotional level can be beneficial as it tugs at peoples' heartstrings and prompts them to want to prevent an event like this from  happening again.  The Camp Fire's irregular spreading patterns show that it was largely influenced by climate change.
       <br><br>

Professor Hiltner talks about how Montecito was effected by mudslides. It doesn't matter how well off you are. No one is safe against climate change. In previous years, less developed countries have experienced a majority of the negative effects of climate change. When it was just these poorer places experiencing the bad effects it made it easier for people to overlook it. However, now that climate change is beginning to personally effect the wealthy, even  more people are beginning to wake up and realize the severity of the issue. It's a sad truth that many people only begin to care about things when it starts to impact them personally.

After watching this documentary, I actually feel sad and even angry for the people who suffer from wildfire and even die from wildfire. We, human beings, are so small and so weak in front of  our mother nature, in this case, wildfire. Instead of showing tons of the statistics, this documentary warns us by showing the direct cause of climate change, wildfire. The spreading speed of fire really astonished me. The fire fighter could not really control the fire effectively due to the fast spreading speed. The wildfire is just one consequence of climate change. If we do not take action right now, more and more catastrophes like that will happen. We have to stop it before it's too late.

I genuinely could never even imagine the fear that must be present when watching your house burn down. I cannot imagine worrying about where you are going to live, what you will do, and the complete feeling of helpless that comes with all of those situations. Natural disasters are cruel and take no mercy of any kind- and the Paradise Fire falls under said category. If this was not such a horrific event I would have thought this was a joke. Imagine having the one people with the responsibility to plan and protect you to essentially do the opposite of. I thank people for their service, it is not easy to put your life on the line and I respect people for their ability to serve. However, I find that there was-in my opinion- negligence. Your job is to be prepared in every single scenario because fires do not follow evacuation plans. The fact is that there was a massive lack of communication that is partly responsible for the destruction caused but in this case for the mentality and lives of the Paradise Citizens.
       <br><br>

This situation seems to be a perfect storm. You cannot put it out because of the road, nor via air, and you must continue to let it grow. When the fire has turned into a full monster, then there became problems in regards to the people. 80 football fields a minute, that is how fast that the fire was spreading and I have problems even comprehending how fast that appears to be. 
       <br><br>

The 911 operator was giving false information, not through a fault of her own but at the same time the people were being given a false sense of hope and this would create a disaster very soon. Human caused climate change has doubled wildfires in the west and all of California has suffered from this. Too much was going on for the fire that caused rapid movement as well as devastation. Patients were evacuating, people getting out of surgery, thrusted upon such dangerous conditions, and there was such hopelessness from the people. I completely understand that there was no way to control a fire that big but instead of damage control, the lack of control made more damage and that is something that I personally could ever forgive. My heart goes out for almost 90 people who died and were made homeless because of this fire.

After watching "Fire in Paradise" , it is evident there are many ignorant people who don't care what happens around and in our environment as long as it helps them. This is deeply saddening and worrisome on a personal level because it was very close to my hometown Stockton, CA. After just a day or two, smoke could be seen all around my city even though were 2-3 hours away from Paradise. It affected all of the surrounding counties including mine with bad air quality. This affected me personally by spiking my allergies to occur almost daily. To begin with, PG&E was the cause of the paradise fire. They were ignorant and should have been severely punished for the 85 lives taken away due to this fire. Instead, they were punished minimally. They were careless as they care only about growing their business and making money. Similarly, Trump and his generation are also careless when it comes to these fires. They are in a state of "denial" as mentioned in earlier videos. This is proven when Trump said the fires were caused by "gross mismanagement" of our forests. People and businesses like these only care about the economy and not our environment.

I have lots of family who live in chico, the neighboring town to paradise, so this film was also emotional for me. My family had told stories to me of what it was like while the fire was destroying the nearby forests but it was never truly conveyed to me until I watched this movie. The director did a great job of portraying the chaos the fire evoked.
       <br><br>
When I took AP environmental science in high school, I learned all about California's mismanagement of the forests. Their previous goal of preventing fires at all costs ended up leading to larger fires that wreaked more havoc and were harder to stop. Although California's forest management has improved since these mistakes happened, it is scary to think that with a warming climate, the danger of these fires will only worsen because at the end of the day humans can only do so much to prevent the wrath of mother nature.

PG&E was responsible for the fire in my hometown in October 2017. The Tubbs Fire was then the most destructive wildfire in California history, burning 36,807 acres per Wikipedia. PG&E was responsible if I remember correctly only because they did not do their due diligence checking the power lines before incredible winds swept them up starting the fire. I was evacuated and the only reason my house is still standing is because they lit a backfire and dug a fire line with a bulldozer less than 300 feet from my front door. I spent that first night with two hours of sleep helping my friend's families pack all their belongings, cutting trees down, clearing leaves and other kinds of kindling, spraying as much as we could down using a pump we led into our neighbors' pools. A lot of my friends lost their homes. I had no idea this was not the only fire PG&E was responsible for. It's appalling to me that such a big corporation can get away with causing such devastation and killing dozens of people. I thought this was a wonderful and compelling documentary that highlighted what corporations can get away with, like the lobbying in Santa Barbara that halted real action against climate change. I also thought it showed how incredibly unprepared we are should great devastation result from climate change and we are forced to adapt. 
       <br><br>


We have to take action to make sure we are prepared for the next climate catastrophe or we will likely face serious devastation. I hope another disaster does not have to happen for us to learn we must be more prepared.

I think this film is really necessary for us to realize the true impact that these disasters are and how truly horrible they are. Growing up in California, I sort of just got used to seeing new fires all the time. I even had a couple fires get fairly close to me, even to where ash would start falling on us. But even with this, I still never realized how bad they can be because it had become such a normal thing to me. Fires just seemed like another part of living in California, and I would see the acreage burned number just climb and climb, with the record constantly being broken. It's hard to understand what something like 200,000 acres is and how large of a chunk of the state just went up in flames. It's sad that I need this documentary and personal stories to really understand the impact. I have learned to not take things for granted as much anymore because now we are living in a world where it is more and more likely that another one of these fires could happen and I could be one of those people talking in the documentary. Often it would be easy to feel sorry for these people for a little bit, but then our minds move on and we just focus on another bad thing happening in the world but never think any of this could happen to us. This film, however, changes that thought process and makes us realize that these fires and other disasters from fires can happen in more and more places, even in the richest of areas like Montecito. It takes understanding. these people's suffering and losses to realize what we could lose in an instant. It proves that the consequences of climate change are not far off in the distance but happening right now right around us.

After reading the comments, I think we can agree that the film does a really good job of emotional appealing to the audience. Through the intimate interviews with the survivors about their life and death moments, the film effectively emphasizes the fact that the climate crisis isn't just about abstract numbers and statistics, but rather an urgent crisis affecting people just like us, who have homes and family that they have to take care of.
       <br><br>

The part of "Fire in Paradise" that hit the hardest for me is when Christina knew she had to leave due to how dangerous conditions have gotten around her home, and tried to convince her mom to join her, and she just wouldn't budge. The fact that she had to choose between saving a loved one and saving her own life is frustrating, and tragic, and heartbreaking. I think she is justified in her anger towards the authorities as they could've done a better job warning everyone of how serious the circumstances were and could've been better prepared for rescue.
       <br><br>

I was quite angry and disturbed that a company like PG&E was able to get away time and time again; as the video stated that the company had been fined hundreds of time due to many reasons like faulty equipment and that it is a repeat offender in terms of putting its surrounding at risk, but the loophole lies in the fact that you can't take a corporation and put it in prison. It makes me think that the reason the issue of climate change is such a pervasive issue is that these big corporations either refuse to abide by new policies or they buy out politicians, and I think a big reason for that is because these leaders and corporate owners are able to hide behind the label of their brand; therefore, when people say that oh this is a terrible company, it's the company that is terrible, that has nothing to do with the people that own it, and I think these people, they're able to ride on that anonymity, with their loads and loads of cash, without their characters being called into question. So what I think we need to do is, in one way or another, as a crowd, we need to call them out on their bs. We need to remind ourselves that there are people responsible for ruining our planet and we need to call them out. Although I don't know yet how we can do that, I think this film is good in that it makes us feel angry, and in this case, anger is a positive emotion because it signals to us that something is wrong, and propels us to take action.

For all of my life I have been living in Northern California and although I fortunately did not live through the nightmare of the Camp Fire, I can still say it impacted the way I see the world today. I am originally from San Jose, just a couple hours away from the small town of Paradise. I still remember being able to see the smoke in the air and the sun appearing scorching red. Schools in the bay area were cancelling classes and sports events as the week in November progressed. It was the first and largest wildfire that I remember hearing of, and I can honestly say I was very afraid. I constantly checked the containment status of the fire, hoping that it wouldn’t continue to spread and reach Chico; where my brother studied at the time. I would say that this unfortunate event is what opened my eyes to the ongoing issues of climate change for I soon realized that wildfires have been occurring more frequently than ever before, that they’ve become year-round. At the time, however, I wasn’t aware of how exactly the Camp Fire had come to exist, that is until now.
       <br><br>

For a while now I have been aware that big corporations are to blame for the majority of fossil fuel emissions, but little did I know that big corporations such as PG&E could be responsible for events such as mass arson. It is evident that corporations will ultimately be the end of us since they have little to no regard for the common individual, whether it be their negligence and lack of tower maintenance or the pollution of our once-before clean environment. They are in control of their actions, they just chose not to act responsibly, as such is the case for PG&E. They were well aware of the possibility of equipment malfunction and of creating a fire due to unusually dry weather and heavy winds. 
       <br><br>

The sad reality is that nowadays we can expect a fire to take place in California every fall. The state is increasingly and unusually getting warmer and prolonged droughts are now more common. I just fail to understand as to how some people can still be oblivious to the fact that climate change exists. It is ridiculous to say that climate change is just a crazy scientific speculation. It’s right under our noses, and if we don’t act quickly it will only get worse.

While watching this documentary on the camp fire, I was thinking about the cause of the fire. At first, I thought that climate change didn't really have nothing to do with this incident and that PG&E was the one to blame for this. After watching the film, I realized that climate change did in fact have a major impact on this fire. If temperatures weren't so high and humidity was higher, the fire definitely wouldn't of grown as fast and big as it did. It reached paradise in the matter of a few hours. The fire could have possibly been controlled if it weren't for climate change. In terms of all of the controversy surrounding how this could have been prevented, it simply couldn't have. I see this as a wake up call and a warning to the world that we dint act now, things will get much worse. I felt really bad for the people who lost their loved ones and lost their homes. I don mean to be an alarmists but we need to take action now. The fries are only increasing and the climate is worsening. This also reminded me about the fire that recently happened here in the Santa Barbara county. That fire caused our own school to be cancelled. Even though the fire was not close, it still had a major impact on us. This is why we can't just see a fire across thee country and not care, because at the end of the day, it affects all of us.

The film "Fire in Paradise" did a great job of capturing what happened before, during, and after the ignition of the fire and how local authorities and firefighters quickly lost control of the fire. It really shows how unprepared and how fragile our communities really are in the face of a disaster that takes over in the matter of a few hours. I think a film like this is capable of removing this false sense of safety many people feel in our communities and could promote actual effective measures if a grand natural disaster were to occur considering natural disasters are becoming more dangerous and more common as our climate changes.

I think the film, “Fire in Paradise” was very informing, as well as heartbreaking. I thought the film did an excellent job of portraying the fire by using real life footage and human stories. It was actually kind of hard to watch at times, because you can clearly put yourself into their shoes and imagine what it was like. I think this film really did put a “puts a human face on the climate crisis” as mentioned in the video and it’s terrifying. I didn’t think this film would make me feel as emotional as it did. I was unaware of how fast this fire moved, and watching the clips of it really put it into perspective. It only took the fire four hours to eat up the town of Paradise, which is completely insane to think about. In the video, Ken mentioned that the fires in Australia are four times the size of all of the fifteen wildfires in California combined! I can’t even imagine what is is like that. With all of these consequences of climate change happening around the world and all the time, it is hard to believe that some people really don’t think it’s real.

After watching this documentary I remembered hearing about these fires on the news and thinking to myself how scared I would be if I were to ever experience that. I was mad at the fact that first responders did not do enough to save all the people. They knew that intense fires had happened in the past and were intense, yet they did not send an evacuation notice early enough to save people. Most of the people that died were not able to evacuated because they had not yet received an evacuation notice. When a lady was on the 911 line the responder on the phone did nothing to help her the lady got burned alive while she was on the line. The responder just ended the call and went on to the next, I know that it is hard to save everyone but he could have helped her figure out a way to survive. When I saw that they had to evacuate a hospital full of sick people and had to way to transport all the patients made me angry because where were the first responders at, that is their job to help the people. Yet they were no need to be found instead nurses helped transport many of the patients. When I heard the story of the grandpa that did not made it out the fire it broke my heart because he was defenseless he was disable and needed help to move around.
       <br><br>
Wildfires to me are so common to me especially where I live. Every summer there are wildfires near where I live, you can sometimes see the smoke from my house. The air in my town is so bad many sports events or even the elementary children's recesses are canceled due to the bad air quality. Hearing about wildfires in California is so normal that it does not surprise me how frequently they happen. That's the thing that they should not be normal and yet people do not believe in climate change. Drought is was on of the factors why the fire started but the biggest the main reason why it started was the fault of PG&E. This company like they mention in the video should be in prison but they are not an individual so the law does nothing. There are millions of innocent people in jail right now reserving sentence for something they did not do, and why? Well because they are poor. A company like PG&E should not exist after all they caused.

After watching the film and the lecture introduction of Ken Hiltner, I had goosebumps all over my body as I was actually familiar to the area because I was able to hike the area when I was a senior in high school, It was definitely a place to relax and enjoy the fresh breeze as you are close to nature. Yet, the place transitioned to the third phase image depicted in the painting that was showcased by Leonardo DiCaprio from the film “Beyond the Flood”. I am in complete shock as that area had a great community and was filled with incredible views to see. Provided that experience of mine, I am heartbroken to see that the place was ravaged by fire caused by corporations such as PG&E, a notorious corporation that is involved in most devastating fires that occurred in the history of California. The whole film and the entire material of this course is literally reflecting how unprepared we are when calamity starts. Generally speaking, I feel like humanity is underestimating climate change or that they are just “morally lazy” to act when such calamity starts. Additionally, I am really disappointed on the evacuation plans and the road system that was laid out for the people inhabiting the area because it was not much of a help to them at all. In fact, these infrastructures were giving the residents trouble in evacuating the area because of how limited the roads are. Although I was disappointed, I realized that I cannot really blame the residents and the county for having limited resources around them when the fire started raging because of the lack of financial support and just, general support from the government was minimal.
       <br><br>

In the light of limited resources, I was extremely frustrated by the lack of information and updates regarding the fire to the residents of the area. As someone who works in a customer service field for a part time job, I completely understand that the emergency workers for 911 were quite overwhelmed by the vicious fire reports that they were getting that they weren’t able to get information nor spread information back to the residents. However, I find it really upsetting that most of these call workers at first were treating the emergence of the fire as something to not worry about. The 911 workers should have provided the residents to evacuate as soon as possible despite the lack of communication from the fire department.They should have anticipated the worst scenario and gave the residents options to act and evacuate on their own gut when needed be. Then again, I can’t simply place the blame entirely to the 911 call workers because the information they receive is not officially seen as an “emergency situation” at first. Nonetheless, I definitely believe that PG&E and all the other corporations that continue to violate such acts regarding wildfires because they rather see the whole world burn than lose their profit, must be stop or face serious consequences.

The story of the small town of Paradise and the CampFire was heartbreaking to hear. The fact that a small town was completely wiped out by a fire is frightening as it is only a matter of time for more of towns in California to be in high risk fire zones. 
       <br><br>

I was surprised to learn that the fire was started from an old PG&E line because this same corporation had been turning off power before as a preventative measure to prevent fires from breaking out. I also was shocked to know that the Campfire became the worst wildfires in California thus, displaying how the fires are only worsening causing them to out rank one another. 
       <br><br>

The first hand perspectives in the film really made me think about how dangerous wildfires are and how fast they can easily spread. In addition, a lot of the times when I see wildfires on the news or any natural disaster in general it is difficult to really understand the devastation that is caused and the lives that are forever changed. Therefore as climate change continues to impact the world and increase the severity of these natural disasters it is important to recognize just because we do not feel these effects personally does not mean that there are not already happening.

This documentary is a difficult watch but it was terrifyingly effective. The 2018’s Camp Fire was horrific, in a span of hours, an entire town disappeared. The way the documentary incorporated bloodcurdling cellphone footage and video interviews of the victims makes the film extremely effective. It makes it feel entirely too real. The stories of the victims were extremely hard to hear. I think that Cooper and Canepari intended to capture the severe stress the Paradise residents felt as they ran for their lives. This proved to be effective because I felt stressed watching this film. Some shots of the fire were mesmerizing, it’s crazy how something so large and magnificent can be so utterly destructive. When one survivor finds the charred skeleton of his friend in a burned up car, I was horrified. 
       <br><br>

One scene that really stuck with me was when a teacher recalls boarding a bus filled with students making impromptu masks from the driver’s shirt and the sole water bottle. It breaks my heart that there were children suffering in that situation. What made this documentary so effective are the amateurs, from the cellphone videos filmed while fleeing on foot or from inside a vehicle. This documentary was 40 minutes of raw, real footage. In the past five years alone, California has had some of the largest fires in its history and there are definitely more to come. Having been born and raised in California, the film really touched me on a personal level. It’s devastating learning about these disasters happening in my state. We really have to take action now, or our beloved state will be consumed by flames.

</p><hr>



<p>

During the first 10 mins of the video, the word that I heard most frequently is “can’t”.
       <br><br>

Can’t send the aircraft to detect or help control the fire because the wind is too fierce; can’t send the fire engine to the pathway below the fire because it was too close to the fire, therefore too risky; can’t control the speed of which the fire expend because there’s a sudden source of strong wind…
       <br><br>

Indeed, if it had not been for the strong wind, the extreme drought, the paradise wouldn’t suffer from such major catastrophe. However, it wouldn’t have developed into that extreme conditions if one of the “can’t”s was made a “can”.
       <br><br>

Would the citizens not consider the fire a nuisance because of the frequency it occurs and the fact that it was November, they could have earned themselves more time to escape. Would there be more investment in the fire department, so that they are more prepared when coping a windy day like this, so that they can use better equipment, for instance drones, to help control and detect the spreading of the fire, the fire might be extinguished before it got a chance to expand. If the fire department was allowed more employees, they could have cleared out multiple firebreaks along the mountains so that we could earn ourselves more time and even have control of the directions at which the fire is spreading to beforehand…
       <br><br>

Wild fires might be the inevitable consequences of global warming. However, when the majority of people are thinking about the bigger picture, the root causes, —climate change, there should be someone thinking about something more practical.
       <br><br>
Such as: are these damages truly inevitable and can we do any precautions to minimize the damage or, prevent them even before it occurred?

The film “Fire in Paradise” paints a very good picture of the realities of what wildfires really do and how they really affect the communities affected by them. I remember when the Paradise fire happened and how scary it was during that time. My hometown is about 2 hours away from Paradise and even we were affected by the fire, my high school canceled school for almost a week due to the air quality being bad enough to cause breathing issues. Seeing how destructive this fire was and how terribly managed the evacuation was makes me angry, angry at the fact that there even was a fire this big, angry at the fact that the threat of a fire wasn’t taken serious enough to provide better roads for evacuation. 
       <br><br>


I do think that this is a great example though of what large corporations paired with climate change can do, PG&E has played a large part in a majority of the major fires that have happened in California in the last few years. It is hard not to point fingers at them due to evidence at hand, but as it was pointed out in the documentary, normally the incident that happened would be an easy solve but paired with how dry the area was it was devastating. We have seen this a lot with the other wildfires that have occurred, this is what makes California so susceptible to wildfires. California’s lack of rainfall are a very large contributing factor to the wildfires that have happened and that is due to climate change. Purely blaming this wildfire on PG&E is not only incorrect but also dismisses the direct effect climate change has on California.

“Fire in Paradise” brought back memories of my roommate from last year. I remember that he was In panic after hearing about the fire and I wondered why he seemed so worried. Little did I know that he had family in paradise and they had been missing. Time went by and after a few days his family members reported to his parents that they were safe and had fled from paradise without any of their belongings. Reflecting on the film, I think about the raging footage of the wildfire and think about how terrified citizens like the family members of my roommate were at the time. The film gave me a new perspective on victims of wildfires such as the one in paradise. From the hospital evacuations, to the phone calls recorded, I can’t help but wonder what I would do in such a situation. The worst part of all of this is how normalized wildfires have become due to the climate crisis. 15 of the 20 deadliest wildfires have developed in the 21st century. If we continue to engage in this vicious cycle, more and more lives will be lost, and towns will perish at the hands of these wildfires. A primary example of what’s to come is happening right before our eyes. As ken stated, Australia is burning and species are being destroyed in the billions. This fire is 4X the size of the last 15 wildfires combined, and the world is acting like it’s a natural phenomenon that “just happened”. In some ways these climate change deniers are right, if we continue to ignore the inevitable, Deadly wildfires that burn entire civilizations will become a norm. We have to be better, we have to listen to scientists who devote their careers to solving these issues, rather than worrying about in economy that’ll be nonexistent if we do nothing.

"Fire in Paradise" allowed me the opportunity to look past my own ego and remember that the Camp Fire effected real people. With the amount of global devastation continuously filling our news feeds on any given day it is far too easy to become so detached from the fact that these tragedies are befalling fellow human beings only a few short hours away. The documentary reminded me that, as a Californian, I could very well find myself in a similar situation to the people of Paradise. 
       <br><br>
To be honest, I was somewhat stricken by the police officer who said that people should be "responsible for their own safety". The lack of evacuation notice and poorly designed escape routes Paradise's citizens faced are absolutely terrifying. During the film I found myself imagining stepping out of a lecture at UCSB to see a fire tearing its way down the mountains around campus, with no call to evacuation and very little direction from authorities. What would I do? What would we all do? It's not a reality that any person wants to face. And yet, due to climate change fueled droughts, will only become more common for us in California. This week's assignment has me wondering what fate will meet Santa Barbara first; burn to a crisp or erode into the ocean?

This documentary was absolutely heartbreaking. The film makers really got into the emotional and personal trauma the people of Paradise went through during the fire from the girl and her grandpa, to the daughter who left her mother (which I still don't totally understand because how could you leave your mom behind regardless if she thought it was fine?). The documentary showed the up-close aspects that people didn't really get to see just on the news, and it opened my eyes as to what really happened. I didn't know the predicament with code red or that PG&E was even involved (although I can't say I'm surprised). 
       <br><br>
   I am from Northern California and I remember when this was going on and trying to help friends that lived in Chico. My school had two days off because the air was so bad in my town, we all were so confused as to what was happening. I remember trying to help people I knew send clothes and food to the people that lost their homes. There were never any serious fires that happened near where my family lives until this one and it's so upsetting when you want to help as much as you can as people are sitting in their houses or cars just burning alive, but you can't. I was taking AP Environmental Science at the time and our teacher broke down in class trying to explain the situation, and told us we could raise money to give to organizations helping paradise. This is when I became really interested in environmental issues and how I could possibly help people in climate change related disasters.
         <br><br>
 This film slightly upset me for the fact of how unorganized it was. They had a bs evacuation plan and they knew if something happened the roads were not big enough and no one would get out. When the officer was asked why they didn't prepare for this worst case scenario and he replied that he couldn't answer, that upset me. Yes, people should fight for themselves and get out without authorities telling them to, but they can't do that if they have no idea what is going on. Police officers and firefighters should ALWAYS prepare for worst case scenarios and be ready to protect their citizens, because climate change is happening, they were in a drought for 8 months, and there's no reason they shouldn't. Messages should have been sent whether people signed up or not, I think that is ridiculous. I think a lot could have been prevented and they wouldn't have had 85 casualties with the right planning, knowing they were fire-prone.

As a freshman, I watched as the Thomas Fire became closer, and fled Santa Barbara as poisonous air quality descended over the region. This is my third year at college, and each fire that floods the state has impacted each and every one of us. "Fire In Paradise" shows a horrific picture of what was done, what could have been done, and what our futures may look like. It was devastating, and it made me angry. How could this have been prevented? And what can we do to prevent anything like this from happening again? But the reality is is that this is our new reality, the film shows. The fire spread so quickly and so much harm was done. It’s haunting to watch, and I remember receiving news alerts about the fire in real time. California is on fire, and it seems as though it will forever be on fire for the near future.

“Fire in Paradise” was a heartbreaking documentary that hit especially close to home due to the fact that this fire was located in California and that both my home town in Northern California and my college town of Santa Barbara were just recently threatened by similar large and tragic fires. Growing up, although we were always warned about California’s wildfire season, the possibility of a severe fire that had the potential to destroy homes and cities seemed highly improbable. However, as the fires in the past few years have shown, climate change (which has brought high temperatures and extreme droughts) has made this threat very real.  What happened in Paradise is a clear example of the worst-case scenario and highlights the frightening truth, which is that we are not prepared for an extreme fire in these new climate conditions. It was especially unsettling watching the documentary, seeing so many situations go wrong and so many systems failing, all while knowing that this could have all happened (and could still happen) to the city I live in. 
       <br><br>


This film does a very good job of showcasing that the effects of climate change are already here and are impacting cities and lives much closer to home than people realize. It talks about climate change without making it the focus of the film and instead puts a human face to a natural disaster caused by climate change, allowing viewers to connect emotionally to this tragedy. This approach helps avoid making the climate change debate the main takeaway from this film and presents the climate crisis as more of a human crisis.

Being from California as well, I also found that the film resonated very close to my heart. Even being from Ventura County who dealt with it's own set of fires, it's easy to become numb to it all. I remember hearing vaguely about the Camp Fire in Paradise and that it was quite disastrous, but I never knew the full scale of it all. This film made me realize how much we don't know about what is happening to other people in the world, even if it's less than a state away. For me, this film caused an overwhelming feeling of disappointment- disappointment with PG&E who we pay and trust to be responsible, disappointment with lawmakers who decided money was more important than expanding the road to keep people safe, disappointment with the lack of media coverage in the wake, disappointment with the lack of change made post-fire with regard to the climate crisis. There's so many ways in which the deaths and the damage could have been avoided, yet no one seems to be taking these steps even for the next fire that will predictably come sooner than later. I just read an article about huge amounts of funds being designated towards future disaster relief, but with no acknowledgement of the cause of such disasters. The money should be going to the root of the problem, and it angers me that the adults in power are acting more like children, trying to cover a bullet hole with a bandaid...

This documentary film is more shocked than any other disaster film that I ever seen. Especially when I see the scene that spark is flying around every where and people are desperately surrounded by deadly fire. We can see how the despair spread rapidly, but we can also notice the hope brought by not only authority but also brave citizens. However, what is the most important thing is that we should find out the reason, the origin behind this fire. It is true that the safety violation from PG&E is the trigger for this disaster, but the nature is supposed to have its own defensive system. In other word, the situation might not horrible like this. Something is going wrong, and that is our climate. The climate change has risen the temperature in CA about 2.5 Celsius degrees, and less and less rainfall has made the atmosphere very dry. This reminds me how ridiculous for some people to consider climate change as a joke. And this is an indirect proof to show that “The inhabitable earth” is not exaggeration, it is what happening all over the world. What’s worse, if we don’t do anything about it, the effect of climate crisis would spread as fast as the fire in paradise. People won’t proactively react until the thing come to their face, but things like the fire won’t give us too much chance to hesitate. Even Paradise town has a well-developed evacuation plan, it is still too powerless confronting such a massive fire. And the property burnt out by that fire is also a huge number, so why don’t people just use this money to slow down the climate change before it happening?

In response to this film its honestly just frightening to see this fire initially go down and the effects of how it spread and affected these people in the city of Paradise. The fact the people hadn’t been warned or had almost been told to not worry, then all a sudden had to be evacuated is just shocking and worrying. The mass and size of this fire as well is almost movie like in a sense, I wasn’t completely informed on this fire incidence prior to watching this film, so seeing this atrocity happen for this first time is mind-blowing. It’s almost annoying to think these people had even thought about this happening prior and had plans to evacuate that were in turn just not sufficient for this size of a fire. Hearing that the fire was visible from space and had burned down Paradise in a mere 4 hours is just again, mind-blowing.


       <br><br>

Looking at this film and how climate change increases the intensity of these fires is again quite sad that our actions are allowing for this to happen at such alarming rates. It opens the eyes of viewers because we see that climate change even affects us in crisis' like fires and not just weather and what not. The fact that we live in Santa Barbara and have first hand seen vivid fires very close to us is frightening and alarming. It creates a sense of awareness and thought of how us students would have to evacuate if a fire were to make its way to Isla Vista. Another mind-blowing idea is how PG&E is bankrupt and had been the main issue/starter of the fire.

"Fire In Paradise" is such a heartbreaking documentary that really shows the severity of fires and the effects it can have. Growing up in California I am no stranger to hearing about fires occurring but I've been lucky enough to have never experienced one close to home. My thought was always that these fires would simply cause people to evacuate at worst but never to the extent of danger that this documentary shows. Seeing the residents frantically pack up and leave everything behind in hopes of making it out alive seemed so unreal and made me realize just how much danger these fires can cause. I could never imagine having to evacuate in that same situation without even knowing if you would make It out alive, it is crazy to think all this damage and hurt was caused by a fire and in such a short amount of time. 
       <br><br>

I think if there is anything one should take out of this documentary it is that we could all possibly  be in that same situation one day. We shouldn't just treat fires as a normal thing anymore and begin to realize the effects it can cause. Educating ourselves on how to react in these type of situations is important but education on why these disasters occur is just as important in order to prevent them in the future.

In the film “Fire in Paradise,” the fire was started on a valley. The line was almost 100 years old and was owned by PG&E, American’s largest electricity company. The fire started from a piece of equipment that failed, bringing a power line in contact with the steel tower. The company could turn off the power lines, in the area that was in danger, to reduce wildfire risk, but they didn’t do it, because they said that the wind was decreasing. The mountain was steep, so the car could not get there immediately. The wind is big, so they could not use a helicopter. That’s the reason they lose the best time to control the fire. The fire burns over the canyon, and people live in the Paradise have to evacuate from their house and hospital. They are surrounded by fire. The fire had a lot of paths, and they all happen at the same time. The government doesn’t have plan to evacuate the whole town before, so the people are all stuck in the road. The alert system was new, so a lot of people didn’t receive the official evacuation order, and they stay at home and refuse to leave. 
       <br><br>
Climate change has contributed to making the fire bigger and more frequent. If people cut down more trees, emission more gases, and don’t take any action to control climate change, the climate would be worse. The weather would be drier, the rain would be less than before, so the fire would be bigger and more frequent. That causes the weather drier than before. That’s a vicious cycle. The fire is terrifying, I think we should take action, like setting a good evacuation plan.

This documentary hit me hard. Not because I haven’t seen or been affected by climate change personally, but because I have never lived in a place where I felt like I was in eminent danger due to fire. Growing up in suburban Seattle, until the past few years, fire was not something that crossed anyone’s mind. We were more concerned about too much rainfall, tree-fall, and landslides, especially in rural logging communities. I grew up knowing nothing about fire and not having any first-hand understanding of its destructive power. The last few years, Seattle has been smoke-filled during the Oregon and British Columbia fire seasons, with horrible air quality, worse than some of the worlds most polluted cities. However, last quarters fire was the first time I had personal experience with it, and coupled with this documentary, I was harshly introduced to the realities of climate exacerbated fire in California.

In the documentary Fire in Paradise, it takes time as line and creates an atmosphere of crisis and tension. Just looking at the video recording of the incident, I seem to feel the burning sensation of the approaching fire, the heat wave in the air and the choking smoke. As the traffic passed by on both sides of the road, I can't help wondering if I can stay calm and escape if I am in this situation? Big fire can really evoke people's original fear. I remember the first time that I heard of wildlife while I was not in California. I was shocked when I first saw wildfire in the video, but not nearly as much as I was when I saw one last Thanksgiving in Santa Barbara. On the day of the fire, my cell phone kept getting emergency alerts about fire situations and evacuations. The blazing fire was burning recklessly in the mountains. Fortunately, the last fire died out quickly and there were no serious injuries. This documentary relives the tragic scene of the fire and makes people witness the deterrent power of nature. However, the main cause of the fires is climate change, but part of the reason for the deaths and injuries is the lack of foreknowledge of the dangers of the fires and the lack of timely notification. Any natural disaster should not be underestimated and must be seriously faced and dealt with.

The film "Fire in Paradise" hit close to home. A family friend lived in Paradise and almost didn't make it out due to the traffic jams. She said there was fire all around her car and she could feel the heat through the windows. She ended up losing almost everything she owned, including her house. The fire was a huge wake up call to her and she moved to a place that is at much less of a fire risk.
       <br><br>
The film did a good job of telling the tale of how the fire started and grew so fast. It was interesting to see how there was a plan in place to evacuate only part of the city in such a hazardous area. With shorter rainy seasons and hotter summers they should have saw that a large fire was destined to come eventually.

The film, Fire in Paradise explains the causes of the fire in the town of Paradise, California. We are told the story by real life first accounts and telephone operator conversations that occured in that day. The point is for us to put ourselves in the shoes of the people who watched the fire unfold. We hear and watch the heartbreak of people losing their homes and loved ones due to such a drastic wildfire. I cannot possibly imagine what it must feel like to be helpless while the fire spread so quickly. We are moved to empathize with the survivors and are urged to take a stand to solve the climate crisis before more and even worse wildfires and other natural disasters occur again. It breaks my heart to think of how many more lives must be lost before the government will take action and at this point is hard to believe they ever will. 

       <br><br>

The very humane and emotional approach the filmmakers chose to take is very profound and genius for we as an audience feel an obligation to do something. Anything. The only problem we often face is what? What must we do in order to reduce the number of these tragedies? Who is to blame for these problems such as the fire? How can they be brought to justice? Are we all to blame? These are the questions the film asks and ones we must find an answer to. I believe this film was incredibly effective in showing us how the climate crisis is a crisis for all of humanity. Climate Crisis will begin to affect people from low socioeconomic classes but will eventually affect even the richest if it is not  resolved. This film shows how drastic and extreme climate change can be in the home front, climate change is not an issue that will only affect the remote and desolate of areas. It will affect us all. We needed to see that this will affect us even in our very backyards in nearby counties. The most devastating fact is that very few local governments are taking environmentally conscious decisions and continue to support businesses who add to the climate crisis.

After watching this documentary, I can feel and understand how those people were feeling after the fire. Especially when the girl said that after they evacuated from the fire and went back to the house and found her grandfather’s wheelchair outside of the house. People that experienced this might not only feel sad and traumatized but also were blaming themselves that they did not have the ability to go back to their house and save their families. I would never imagine this kind of thing that could happen to the people around us before I know about the fire in Paradise. We should notice that the earth is getting dryer and dryer, with this kind of catastrophe California people had experienced. Australia, right now, are experiencing lots of fire as well. They were experiencing several months without any rainfall. If we do not do anything, not even the little things we can do within our own power can ever reach, there may be things even worse.

The documentary gives us a very good experience of how it was like to be in such a terrible wildfire with footage as well as a scientific analysis of the reasons behind. When watching the documentary, I could almost feel how desperate people were trying to escape from “hell”. It was horrifying to see that the entire hospital has to evacuate in such a hurry, carrying patients that were just finished with their surgeries. I felt suffocated until I saw them drive through the fire and see the clear edge between paradise and hell. After watching this documentary, I couldn’t help thinking about the fire that is still soaring in Australia right now. Even the camp fire was as disastrous as one might ever imagine, the fire in Australia is ten times more devastating. So many lives have been killed so far, and the tragedy is still continuing. And I have heard that during the time of fire, President Scott Morrison was away from Australia in his vacation. This made me think about the inequality of this society behind the climate crisis. What’s more irritating is that he blamed the wildfire all on camels for causing the extremely dry weather in order to escape from his own responsibility. Thousands of more lives would die just as a scapegoat of such a ridiculous excuse! This should not be tolerated. To reverse the climate change, one thing that we have to do is to wipe this sorts of people out of their dominant stance in politics. Otherwise, the doom of our civilization might not be faraway.

As being someone from Northern California, this documentary hit very close to home. I have a brother that goes to Chico State that was about 15 min away from Paradise, and he had to evacuate during this time. I remember about 10 months ago I played in a golf tournament where one of the school was Paradise High School. I talked to and played with a couple of students there and they would only briefly mention it for most of them lost their homes during the fire. This documentary hit very close to home. Every moment from the documentary I remember being reported to me at home, and the billowing smoke that descended down on my hometown was also brought back to my mind.
       <br><br>


This documentary also angered me, unlike any of the other article or videos prior. It angers me in the way that our government continues to fight with one another over the issue instead of taking positive action when people are losing their homes as well as their lives. Last year my school took a trip up to Paradise to put on a Science Expo for the kids of the elementary school and some of the kids where coming from 2 hours away just to go to school everyday. When I was younger, going 20 minutes to get to school seem hard, try 2 hours. Many days, the teachers said, children would have to stay at home because their parents didn't have time to take them to school because they had to go to work. This issue is bigger than politics, this is a life or death matter for every individual, not just those close to the danger.

In the film “Fire in Paradise”, the viewer is taken through a massive fire that occurred in the city of paradise causing huge chaos and destruction. Survivors of the fire tell their stories of what occurred through their perspectives and give an idea of what it would be like for anyone who would have had to go through that. Seeing how desperate they were for a way out of the city while being surrounded by fire in all directions made me even feel anxious for them to find a way out. In times of need most people seek for professional help and unfortunately in this situation even the fire department, police, etc. did not know what to do. The miscommunication or lack of better technology caused the emergency dispatchers to give people misguided directions since they were not even aware how quick the fire was spreading. Seeing how much of an impact this fire had on the lives of these people and how so many lives were lost makes me realize that this is the future that is waiting for us if the climate crisis is not taken seriously. The devastation the fire caused in the city was enormous. Just picturing that the fire could be seen from outer space gives us an ideal of its magnitude. Unfortunately many more fires will occur if action is not taken. And just like in this situation we will be helpless and desperate for help except there will be no way out because disasters will be occurring everywhere. Now is the time to seek help for the future. In order to take measure to ensure that the catastrophes like this one do not get worse.

“Wow” is really all that I can muster up after finishing this film. I still cannot wrap my mind around just how fast the Camp Fire took place, how much was lost, and how much was documented. It was insane to learn that it only took 4 hours for the fire to start and consume the entire town of Paradise. Someone could have left California in the morning, flown to New York, and by the time they landed their entire house and community would have been burned down and they without have had the slightest idea of something being wrong before they left. 
        <br><br>
I am from Northern California and this fire took place last year just as I and many of my hometown friends were leaving for our first year of college. A large group of my friends are ones who chose to attend Chico State, also located in Butte County where the Camp Fire took place. I remember seeing their social media updates marking themselves “safe” and other posts complaining about the conditions they were in. Most notably I remember seeing my friends’ posts go from at first complaints about their situation to deep remorse and horror at the devastation around them. I saw videos on snapchat of burned cars and scored highways as my friends left campus to come home while Chico State was closed. It was surreal to see nearly the exact same footage in the documentary. 
       <br><br>
 All in all: this film, although not particularly about climate change, is a clear example of its consequences. It hits close to home for me and is truly terrifying to think about how quickly things in life can change. Really puts things into perspective for me and makes me grateful for every day that I have with my family and the things around me.

Last quarter I was here at UCSB when massive fires affected areas of Los Angeles, where I am from. I have friends at UCLA, who were affected by the toxic air until classes that were eventually canceled. I even have a friend at Mount Saint Mary, which sits upon hills that were engulfed in flames. The scene was horrific, as people running down the hill with their belongings Thankfully, my family was not close enough to be affected, but the situation hit very close to home. I did not return to LA until about a week later, where clouds of smoke still covered spots in the sky.
       <br><br>
It is extremely unfortunate what happened in Paradise, such that much of it could have been avoided if certain people had not been so negligent. PG&E's decision to not shut off the power was incredibly irresponsible and they should be held accountable. Cal fire as well could have prevented such damage had they been more careful and responsive to the situation. I was so affected by the film not only because of my ties to LA, but I think the documentary does a great job of tapping into the viewer's emotions and evoking sympathy. Its use of real-time footage and conversations allow the viewer to feel as if they are involved. Such emotional reactions are key to getting people to care and take action.

This film opened my eyes to a side of wildfires that I have never witnessed, or could begin to understand the severity of. Growing up in Southern California, there were many random fires that flared up and caused public concern, but undeniably, I never faced one of close proximity and real danger. Watching the panicked residents of Paradise frantically pack up their cars (even one resident under extreme pressure be forced to leave her mother behind), hopelessly sit in traffic with thousands of others while flames engulf their sides, and fear for their lives was heartbreaking. The detailed depictions of a survivor burning her body while running from flames reminded me of a scene from a horror movie. It is mind boggling that terrifying events like this can escalate into a situation of innocent civilians trapped in destruction. 
       <br><br>

Drawing on the film’s acknowledgment of poor emergency notification deliverances, I think that it is crucial for the entire city population to receive warning and evacuation messages. Although some may be close-minded about the immediate danger they are in, it is the responsibility of the people in power to utilize it for the most important purpose: to save lives. If more people were aware of how close and rapidly spreading the fires were, possibly this catastrophe could have spared one of the 85 lives lost during that time. It is frightening to settle with the fear that I may have to devise my own evacuation plan, and track natural disasters closely on my own, because I have lost trust in preparedness. Additionally, I understand wider roads and other cautionary measures are expensive and otherwise not used to their fullest, but we should always plan for the worst case scenario, right? Anything outweighs the tragedies highlighted in the film.

I am in the same boat as you, Linnea. Having been born and raised in Southern California, I have also witnessed many random wild fires on television but have never actually felt threatened by one. Seeing how panicked and terrified the residents of Paradise were really put things into perspective for me. I'm so appreciative that I have never been through something like that because it seems absolutely traumatizing. 
       <br><br>

It made me angry hearing of the poor emergency notification deliverances. I feel that some deaths could have been prevented if law enforcement and first responders provided the entire city with warnings and evacuation messages. We have to protect ourselves because this documentary proved that we would be foolish to trust authorities with our lives.

Watching the film “Fire in Paradise” was an emotionally taxing feet. Having been at UCSB since 2017 I have experienced fires in Santa Barbara and even went home to avoid the smoke that choked our campus my Freshman year. Yet in each case, I never felt that I was in imminent danger. I knew I was safe. What was horrifying to watch in the Paradise Fire was the fact that people in Paradise were not aware that they were in danger until the fire was already almost upon them. Many of them believed they were safe and it was difficult to watch those who had survived describe their attempts to help their loved ones. Loved ones who in some cases refused to leave because no evacuation had been ordered for that area.
       <br><br>

 It is sad to think that the severity of this fire would have been less had climate change been less aggressive. Yes, PG&E should definitely face consequences for neglecting their towers and causing the fire. Yes, those responding to the fires should have sent warnings to those in Paradise sooner, and used a better system to send the warnings. But, the most detrimental aspect of the fire was the fact that it was able to spread so quickly and aggressively because of droughts and high winds brought on by climate change. The Paradise fire is only one example of how natural disasters are becoming more pronounced and dangerous, we need to plan for bigger events and try to stem the increasing climate change.

I have had to deal with wild fires and evacuations back at my home, but not to this severe of a level. At the time, I was 17, and there was smoke in the blue sky along with visuals of dead, grassy hills burning. Had to go evacuate my grandparents house, however, they refused to believe that they would be affected by it. Fortunately, the fire department was able to contain the blaze before it affected my family. I tell this story to confirm that we are dealing with the consequences of the climate change here and now.
       <br><br>

My response to the video was that off sadness and helplessness but more so disgust at PG&E.  There was a quote that really stuck with me stating "if  PG&E was an individual, and not just a cooperation, they would be in jail". This really resonated with me as the company had been fined and given multiple citations regarding the health composition of their power lines yet refused to implement change. The cost of fixing the power lines would have been in the hundreds of millions, however, the total cost of the Paradise Fire total ranged in the billions. It's astonishing to me that there were known changes, but the part that really hit hard is that MOST people will seen this, be sad for a few days, then forget about it. It may just be a part of our culture that changes happens due to response rather than creating retroactive change.

I think the film really added to an emotional aspect to the effects of climate crisis. Seeing the paradise  people affected by the fires and them talk about their experience I think was powerful.  I was shocked by how quickly the event seemed to escalate and the chaotic event. I was scared by the fact that the first responders had ask the fire fighters if the fire was far from paradise and they insisted that it was until the situation got really bad. What I did not understand was why the red code alert that would have sent a notice of evacuation for everyone in paradise was not sent rather than the other alert that only notified those who had signed up for it. It is devastating to know that no money was put into roads that could have made the evacuation easier in case of a massive fire like CampFire, knowing that there are many industries that make millions off of the land and they contribute to climate crisis which leads to fires like this. It is cary to think that the town of Paradise had a plan for a fire evacuation but were unprepared for a fire of that magnitude. I did not expected to hear that," ten of the twenty of the most destructive fires in California have occurred within four years”. It is crazy that so much has occurred so fast in a couple of years and all due inaction on climate crisis.Seeing the helplessness of many in that situation was emotionally devastating. There will be more people who suffer through something similar if no action is taken, and the way things are right now I do not see anything being done. They said the fire was big but I did not capture the magnitude of devastation of the fire until it was stated that it was visible from outer space. I really hope this film will not only get people to take action, but also take into mind to prepare truly for the worst by developing well thought out plans and resources in huge catastrophes because times are changing fast. I can only hope that were are prepared to some degree for whatever may come.

Fire in Paradise is a short documentary that tries to illustrate how quickly this disaster hit. Having grown up in California I am very aware of the most popular electricity provider, PG&E. This powerful corporation has been responsible for very devastating wildfires that have left them broke. Will those affected by the fires ever receive compensation or will the bankruptcy of the company screw countless Californians. The severity of fires is something to fear as it can cause such grave consequences in a very short period of time. Living in an area that has become prone to wildfires and knowing it will only get worse is what we should fear in daily life, but as students what can we truly due to make a difference other than getting our degree and hopefully combating this problem.

What an paradox. A fire in Paradise. That title alone can really go lengths in depicting how no place on earth is safe from climate change. Perfect landscapes with rolling hills, ocean tides, magnificent glaciers are all on the road to destruction. A place of paradise cannot co-exist with climate change. To say this film hit close to home would be an understatement. I remember the day it happened vividly. I remember wondering if my great grandparents were going to make it out alive, waiting to hear any sort of word back from them. My great grandparents, ninety-three years old, completely lost their home. They lost the photos they had accumulated over the years, memories lost to the flames. To this day they remain living with their children--my grandparents--as there really is no alternative to house them. I even remember seeing the smoke as far as my home near Sacramento. Watching this film, it was absolutely heartbreaking being the witness to what my great grandparents and all other residents had to experience. Fires have always been one of my greatest fears, ironic coming from someone who's lived in California their whole life, the sad reality is that one would expect me to be accustomed to such tragedies. It's just so despairing knowing how much destruction climate change is causing and how little action is being taken to combat this, it's almost symbolic how little action was taken just in the case of this fire. It really translated to the problem as a whole and how nobody is sending out the sirens about the climate crisis when they should be blaring non-stop.
       <br><br>

At least there is some solace in knowing PG&E is being reprimanded for their actions. I'm just waiting until the actual fossil fuel companies start getting their share of genuine heat, whether that be through the climate crisis or an uprising.

When this fire of Paradise was burning in California, I was still at home back in China. We all heard about the fire from the news, except all we know was based on just a few sentences saying there is a huge fire spreading in California and was still not put out. My family and I was worried because California was exactly where I wanted to go to college. That’s all we felt and all we cared. But watching this documentary makes me scared. Fear is the only word that can describe my feeling when I saw all the flames and flickers jumping on the streets and catching on people and cars. The clips collected from survivors and the pictures were so surreal that I felt incredibly frightened. The fire has outpaced all the plannings for emergency evacuation and everything the Paradise has ever prepared, because people just couldn’t have envisioned the severity of an issue like this. It’s much more heartbreaking than I imagined seeing so many people trying to help or get help but they just couldn’t do so.
       <br><br>


Besides this emotional side this documentary gives me, one crucial message this documentary tells me is that how powerful the changing climate is. If the climate continues to change, the temperature just continues to rise, the humidity continues to drop, the air continues to become dryer, I believe that any plan will become effortless because our imagination and preparation could never be as fast as the change itself. When the issue has been huge like it already is, we can’t really blame one individual or one corporation like PG&E and condemn them and only them for using transmission towers that are beyond their life spans or shutting down power for the entire county during extremely fire-risky days. If not every single one of us is doing something about the climate change, more tragedies will happen, and one thing for sure that blaming them on one single party is meaningless.

Watching “Fire in Paradise” made me tear up a little. It was so sad to see people fighting for their lives. My roommate walked in on me and asked me what movie I was watching and I told him it was a documentary. He could not believe what he was seeing and neither was I. It is so crazy that this actually happened and it is even scarier knowing that it can happen again. WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE ACTION TO TAKE CARE OF OUR HOME, EARTH. What happened in Paradise should have  been a wake up call. Yes I know the fire was caused by a fault in a power line but if it was not for the humidity and high winds the fire may have been controllable and save so many lives. I really hope the people who suffer from that fire are all okay and doing well, they did not deserve it. This documentary just made me terrified of fire. I just know that I should not underestimate fire.
       <br><br>

When the fire happened here in the mountains I was not scared or worried, but I feel like the next time we have a fire I am going to panic because of this film.

Before I watching this film “Fire in Paradise,” I thought fire as something devastating but remote. The latest contact with the fire was during Christmas last year. However, even though I experienced that event, I still don’t have idea about how destructive it is. That is because what I saw was just smoky sky. I completely realized the fire is a horrible disaster now.
       <br><br>

This film made me feel sad and frustrated. Hearing the first hand stories and watching videos from those who suffered from this disastrous event give me a better understanding of how terrible effects a fire bings. I was also shocked by the speed of fire spreading. The entire town was burned in just a few hours. Moreover, once a fire occurs, it will be difficult to put out. In order to reduce losses and damage, we need to diminish chance of fire occurrence. Climate change will raise the risk of fire. Hence, we should take action quickly.

Similarly as yourself I had no idea how bad the fire was. Last year was my first year at UCSB and when I heard about it I merely chalked it off as a casual fire no big deal. The film “Fire in Paradise” made me realize how devastating it truly was. There had been other fires in this area and they have all been tragic. Before this film I categorized fires as an unlucky but not severe disaster. Recently the first in Australia truly opened my eyes to the devastation they could bring upon. Millions of animals died for no fault of their own. It's truly revolting that helpless creatures were massacred by human ignorance and greed. I can't wait to see how the climate change deniers sweep this horrible event under the rug  and continue with their bullshit of “the climate is always changing.” These fires so close to home is truly saddening, not to say that fires far are not sad, but when you can witness someone's whole life be in ashes you truly feel what true pain is. The change in air quality by these fires was immediately noticed by surrounding folk because it was hard to breath. The number of fires and lives lost will only go up if we continue down the wrong path set by our ancestors.

I thought it was very interesting that Fire in Paradise was this weeks assigned movie/documentary. Although it does address and focus on wildfires caused by drought and is a very disastrous effect on our planet, the film itself was not at all focused on climate change as a whole. After having watched the film I believe that this was a great addition to the course to show another perspective on the climate crisis and how even though at first we do not see the relation between the wildfires and climate change, everything is caused by something and the climate crisis has many different forms. Climate change is not just one thing, it causes "unusual" events to happen in all parts of the world. Many in the United States do not believe that climate change is real, and even if it is, it's effects are happening in other parts of the world so they do not worry about it. This is far from the truth. California alone has had 5 of the most detrimental and worst wildfires in history in the past 10 years alone. Although many simply see it as an unfortunate fire, this is just one example of climate change and how it can happen anywhere, even one of the most wealthiest counties in California. As Hiltner stated in the video, many expected climate change to happen gradually and that is the reason why so many simply ignored it and did not take action on the issue when they had an advantage. If something is not personally affecting a group of people, they will show no concern and continue on with their daily lives with no care in the world. Now that wildfires are becoming an annual thing in California and are only getting worse after each one, I really do hope that we all finally decide to take action and help save our planet for our own future.

Although this film is a documentary, it feels like an apocalyptic horror movie. I felt honestly terrified by much of the footage shown throughout the film. I remember hearing about this fire when it happened but I never saw footage like was shown in the film. I had very little understanding of the sheer destructive power of the fire in Paradise. I felt particularly jarred by the scene depicting the evacuation of the hospital. I felt terror for those who had no way to save themselves and were entirely dependent on others in that situation. I definitely understand the connection between this film and our class material; fires like this will only become more common with the current trends of climate change. The proof lies in the statistics: since 1984, human caused climate change has doubled the rate of fires along the West coast. I personally think that most people are not aware of this correlation between the climate crisis and the rapidly increasing number of catastrophic wildfires. There is only so much that can be done once the fire takes off and prevention of them should be the top priority. I believe that corporations like PG and E should be held entirely accountable when they contribute to the formation of these disasters. PG and E's negligence reminds me of so many big corporations choice to place profit above safety and the environment. It would have cost PG and E more to adhere to safety regulations so they chose to neglect them. This mentality is one of the driving forces of anthropogenic climate change. Corporations prioritize profit above else and continue to ravage the environment with their toxic emissions and massive consumption of fossil fuels.  It is crazy to me that 10/20 of the most destructive fires in California have happened in the last four years. Once you hear facts like this, it is so clear to see that We are the problem but most people are not exposed to this reality. I am again feeling personally attacked by the consequences of climate change. I had no idea that the Thomas fire was so destructive in this area and that it spread at an astonishing one acre per second rate. Ultimately, we are helpless against forces this strong; we have to break this trend of climate change or else we are truly doomed. I do not want wildfires like Thomas or the one in Paradise to become a commonplace event. These are disasters that should not be occurring as often as they are. The final fact you mentioned regarding Australia utterly blew my mind. 4x the 15 largest in California combined is ridiculous to me. Our current world looks bleak to me and will continue to get worse unless things change. Things like this film, are dark but essential calls to action for us.

After watching "Fire in Paradise" I was left in shock at the appearance of the events that occurred on November 8th. As someone who has never experienced a mass catastrophe, or even a truly traumatic event, I cannot even begin to fathom what it is like to lose an entire community: a home. I had never heard of the fire in Paradise until watching the movie, and the fact that it was compared to their "local 9/11" made me realize how many more events like these often go unnoticed by many people like me despite its severity. The negligence of the authorities to successfully notify the residents bothers me as well as everyone deserves to know if their lives and property are endangered. 

       <br><br>

I hope PG&E and other big corporations can be held accountable for their actions. As big businesses commonly utilize an abundance of resources to run their companies such as greenhouse gases, they need to pay for the social costs of their byproducts as well. If they continue to turn a blind eye and maintain a stubborn attitude towards conservation and risk prevention, then they should be punished by the government.

Growing up in a city with a humid climate on the other side of the world, I have never seen any wild fire until last quarter. Even then I was not so worried about the fire as I viewed it far away enough to not pose any danger, but “Fire in Paradise" completely altered my view on how detrimental wild fire could be as well as the ramification of it in California. In the footages, it was shocking to me how the fast spreading fire engulfed forests and structures to the point where so much ashes were produced and day was literally turned into night. It is painful to think that there are many more people out there just like the ones interviewed who lost their loved ones and homes to the fire. Not only were the stories hard to endure, the statistics on the effects of climate change were too: 4 out of 5 of California’s biggest fires happened last decade and a quarter of Californians currently reside in high risk fire zones. As the fire chief said in the interview about how the Camp Fire surpassed all the planning and possible response, the main takeaway I got after watching the documentary is that preventing natural disasters like the fire will require a lot more resources, manpower, and funding in the future as the occurrence of extreme events will only be more frequent as climate change continues. More regulations on businesses and individuals whose actions pose potential threats to the environment also need to be established on a large scale.

Prior to watching the film “Fire in Paradise,” I had no clue how severe the damage of the Camp Fire was or how incredibly fast it spread. The footage of the fires was almost hard for me to comprehend; there was a point where the damage looked as if the fire had been raging for at least a whole afternoon, when in reality it had only been a few hours since the fire had been ignited. The stories shared in this movie were incredibly heart wrenching, and it’s even harder to know that climate change likely exacerbated the damage. This fire hit very close to home for many Californians, including myself, and should serve as a massive wake up call that we’re going to continue to have extreme weather circumstances as long as we continue to contribute to the climate crisis. The Paradise fire was extremely sad, but events like that will become a part of our reality if we don’t start coming to terms with the changes we need to make. 

       <br><br>

One thing that consistently stood out to me during the film was how unprepared the emergency responders seemed to be during the situation. It was obviously an extreme set of circumstances, and they did seem to believe they had many well thought out emergency plans; however, the documentary revealed many errors that had been brought up to emergency preparations teams in the past were not alleviated, such as the lack of capacity the roads could handle. While the circumstances of this fire were more intense than anyone could have anticipated, a man in the film stressed that these are the type of circumstances we’ll need to be prepared for if climate change continues to progress.

I definitely agree that watching this film, "Fire in Paradise" was extremely emotional. Being native to Southern California and Ventura County, I have seen the damage of these wildfires first-hand. I have seen the charred remains of my friend's family home; I have been forced indoors to avoid the hazardous air quality; I have housed friends who had to evacuate their own homes. Through all of this and the anxiety that accompanies it, I never felt the immediate danger and extreme horror that those in Paradise were subjected to. I can't even imagine the terror and uncertainty of this rapidly moving disaster. I agree that it was extremely heart-wrenching to watch and hit very close to home.  
       <br><br>


Being from here, I find it's important to be updated on these fires and their severity. It is important to be informed and I thought I did a good job of that, but after watching this I saw a level of destruction that cannot be portrayed through a simple tweet or CNN update. The level of destruction that was portrayed through this film was a serious wake up call, I agree. The unpreparedness of the general population is frightening and that must change, for this is our new normal.

This film is truly astonishing, I was not aware of the severity of the Californian fires except for the ones that occurred around Santa Barbara. The fire that happened completely stand opposite of the meaning of "Paradise". Thousands lost their homes, property, as well as family members. All of these could be avoided if the county government created a better evacuation system and had a better judgment of the situation. But most importantly, the main antagonist is still PG&E, they have already broken many regulations but continues to create more problem to society. The Camp Fire was initiated by their broken hardware but ultimately they did not take any credit for creating such chaos. I believe that to cease further events from happening, the people need to work together and create a change among the broken systems that is further demolishing the severity of climate change.

The documentary “Fire in Paradise” is shocking. It made me extremely emotional. I’ve accepted the fact that huge wildfires (along with other natural disasters) are now a common occurrence. I can’t believe how close the fires are to actual people and that there were deaths. Climate change is real and affecting real people. People are dying. It frustrates me that some people still don’t understand that fact. Climate change is an unpredictable and chaotic force of nature. We’ve seen nothing yet. More and more environmental disasters are coming. I realize that my comment is pessimistic, but this film really opened my eyes to our harsh future.

This documentary “Fire in Paradise” does not primarily focus on climate change but the reasons and consequences. This film reconstructed the original and comprehensive scene to us. Just like the police officer saying, there was too much happening. The catastrophe is too horrible to imagine and after watching the clips, I am even more shocked. Meanwhile, I was really sad and frustrated watching it, because there was opportunities to prevent the disaster from spreading and for people to evacuate, but because of the incompetence of the government, many people lost their houses, and even their families. That was heartbreaking. As far as I am concerned, the government should try their best to amend the laws and prevent this kind of disaster from happening again. Even though the electricity company PG&E is directly responsible for this accident, we residents in California should take responsibilities as well. It is our home we should protect for.

I thought that the “Fire in Paradise” documentary was an incredibly profound film about a disaster that I otherwise would have probably not thought about again. So many fires have happened in the past few years, even just in California, that they all start to blend together, but the documentary helped me understand the effects of it, not just logistically, but the impact that it had on the people living in and near Paradise. I was surprised at how quickly the fire spread and how it caused so much damage so quickly - even if climate change didn’t start the fire, it clearly propelled its destruction.  
       <br><br>
It also shocked me that the police were telling people not to worry, and that not even the hospital had adequate evacuation time. How does something like that even happen? 
       <br><br>
I think if we are to take anything away from this, it is that we shouldn’t be in any kind of denial that the effects of climate change will affect us - and I mean truly affect us. It is hard to say this with certainty, but if the people of Paradise, especially the firemen and police, had thought of the worst instead of believing that things would be okay, such a disastrous event could have been avoided.

I am glad that fires similar to the Paradise fire are being seen as results from climate change. There is no way our new "normal" fire seasons are normal at all. I am from Northern California and was affected by this fire. I remember walking outside later the day of and seeing smoke cover the sky and ash on my car. Classes were cancelled and we were told to stay inside due to the air quality. My family owns horses and livestock, so when Paradise and the surrounding areas were evacuated, we took our horse trailers up there to help people evacuate livestock. I had never seen something more chaotic and frightening before. My brother was also attending Chico State at the time and the entire university was evacuated so we had to take several trips up to the fire area to evacuate my brother and the livestock. I had never been affected by a fire before until Paradise, and then again for last quarter's fire. Seeing the stories of other people involved in the fire was heartbreaking to me just because I know we did everything we could, but it still wasn't enough. Helping people evacuate was one of the hardest things emotionally I have ever done.

The film “Fire in Paradise” did a really good job at showing the reality of such a large and fast-destructing fire. However, it was devastating seeing how fast the fire destroyed an entire town, burning 80 football fields a minute, especially when 911 dispatchers and fire officials were telling the people in Paradise that they would have no danger. I think the biggest flaw in what happened was the lack of communication between the officials and the residents. The fact that some residents never got an official evacuation order is so frustrating, and although the traffic prevented the residents from leaving the town faster, I think living in a fire danger zone, residents need to practice evacuations since large fires in California have become reality.
        <br><br>

Coming from Sacramento, I vividly remember the day of the Camp Fire. Living only a few hours away, I heard the news quickly and started smelling and seeing smoke in my city. I knew people who had relatives that lived in Paradise. I knew people in town who were giving Paradise residents a place to stay. I donated backpacks and supplies to help people who had lost not only their homes but entire town. As the days went by, the smoke got worse and worse, to the point where school districts in my area were cancelling school so kids wouldn’t have to go outside. Students wanted school to be cancelled so bad, just to selfishly get a day off, and not truly thinking of the reality people have to face: an entire town is gone because of climate change, and we need to be aware that it may happen again.

I feel that the purpose of this film was to show people that climate change can exponentially worsen minor problems and that if action is not taken then these problems can be detrimental to communities and to the environment. I really don't understand what goes on corporation's minds such as PG&E when it comes to the environment. Do they just not care? It's hard to realize that such a devastating event occurred because of this corporations ignorance. 85 lives were lost due to a company refusing to spend money on areas that need to be spent on such as fixing their equipment and making sure everything is up to date and running smoothly without any possible consequence.Turning off power to people's homes should not be a to go to when weather situations become drastic. These people wouldn't have to deal with this problem if businesses were more regulated and if the Climate Crisis was not a political issue but a world issue. I feel that the American dream that was popularized by president Harry Truman has turned reality into a nightmare for others. The only people living this so called "dream" are the CEOs of companies that are ruining the world for the rest of us. It was crazy to learn that the fire spread so fast in so little time and it made me anxious during the hospital scene because I can only imagine the pain people must have felt getting escorted out into small cars while their surroundings were on fire. It literally looked like Hell.

The documentary "Fire in Paradise" exemplifies how the climate change crisis will affect us in many unexpected ways. I'm not sure how much the general public knows about the varying consequences of this crisis, but I know that I don't really know as much as I thought. So this film was eye opening for me and taught me that climate change can act quickly, randomly and bring devastating loss. The film caused me to face the harsh reality of how much my life or the life of anybody else could change because of our greed and inaction. I think it could be a good source to show other people how climate change isn't just one problem and more like an umbrella term for the many catastrophes that can befall humanity.
        <br><br>

A lot of the film and especially the scenes with people were very emotional. Something that stood out was the large amount of people who just stayed in their homes. I can see parallels between the the mother who decided to stay because of the lack of warning and the many people who currently believe that the climate crisis does not exist or is not as widespread and impactful as it could be if we don't start doing things different. I hope that we can take this more seriously and take concrete action.

"fire in Paradise" was an interesting perspective on what took place during the camp fire. In this class it seems that we are often most focused on the underlying and root causes of climate change and climate change disasters. This film was a reminder of the very personal and human emotions that happen to people during a natural disaster, especially one of the size of the camp fire. At the same time it seemed that these root causes were not talked about enough. It almost seemed as if this was treated as some kind of anomalous disaster that would never happen again. Unfortunately as we know, these large scale fires and disasters are going to continue for some time. It is sad that for many people, it takes a disaster like this, is the final straw that may get people to change their behavior. This documentary really seemed to vilify PG&E as kind of the bad guy in this incident. It made it seem that if PG&E had done something different that day, then nothing like this could've happened. Although it is hard to cast blame, I don't think this is something that could be entirely pinned on PG&E. I think we are responsible for the uptick of climate fueled disasters because it is our lifestyles that contribute most to our over use of carbon-emitting fossil fuels. This film could have been more moving if there was a serious call to action for people who live high carbon lifestyles and are ignorant of climate change problems.

During the entire time I was watching "Fire In Paradise" I felt bad for the residents living in the city of Paradise. I can only imagine how scared they were when there was a mandatory evacuation issued for the city. The thing that bothered me the most was how sheriffs kept saying they were safe and wouldn't be affected. I think they should've sent out an emergency message to the residing citizens as soon as they found out the fire reached the outskirts of Paradise. I felt angry that officials didn't handle this issue more efficiently and with more urgency. I was also frustrated with how PG&E still aren't facing any consequences even though they were the ones who caused all of this chaos to begin with.
        <br><br>

On the other hand, I did like how the film was able to show the viewers how fast the fire spread and how it basically destroyed the city. I remember being very emotional when the woman in the film described her experience navigating through the fires and finally reconvening with her husband. I can't even begin to wonder how worried her husband was, not being able to communicate with her in any way. If I were put in their position, I honestly don't know how I would've initially reacted and what I would have done afterwards. Although it's extremely sad how many lives were lost during this fire, I'm so glad so many were able to survive to tell their stories.

Coming from Germany, I had a classic mental image of California: poppin' beaches, good waves, perfect weather, and gorgeous sunshine only broken up by some palm trees. Now that I am here, however, it's a little warmer than they said. It's also a little bit drier, and a little bit more likely to be on fire than I had heard before coming. When I first saw the fire on the mountain side before Thanksgiving, I was essentially blown away. What a bummer to see something so beautiful as our local environment being turned into a grill. I was even more blown away when I heard that this fire was not only major, but in fact minimal compared to ones that have happened here, as well as all throughout California. "Fire in Paradise" ushered me into a much deeper understanding of the pressure a changing climate puts on ecosystems in a particular method: Wildfires. Wildfires, just like they sound, are pretty wild. The idea of you neighborhood being engulfed in flames is horrifying. The jaw dropping footage displayed in the film was enough to make me want to turn it off and bounce out to Alaska, but riveting enough to keep me viewing. By seeing these footages, I feel people will be more able to say, "Hey, the climate is really changing, and it's clearly causing some pretty nasty things to occur". 
        <br><br>

I hope that people will be able to see a film like this and move forward with an essentially "personified" climate change in mind.

Fire in Paradise was extremely moving to me, and also very emotional. I wish they had shown us the faces of everyone that passed. So many people lost their lives.. we need to get climate change deniers to watch this documentary and maybe they would be swayed. Reading about this catastrophe is a lot different than watching first hand how many people were affected and either lost everything or payed the ultimate price. As you said, wildfires are pretty wild.

I was prepared to see the devastations within the film "Fire in Paradise" because I had been keeping up with the fire during its procession. Hitting so close to home, it was terrifying to hear of relatives and close friends having to evacuate their homes, leaving their life behind. Even more terrifying is the fact that these fires have become a normality, almost an unfortunate expectation, each year. If we don't act soon it will be our children and grandchildren who will experience worsened disasters on a normal basis. I appreciate that Ken draws attention to the realization that there are so many more disasters present and arriving, so much so that we need to pay attention to them actively and take them as valuable signs that change is necessary.

Watching Fire in Paradise gave me not only an insight as to how bad a large fire could get but also reminded me of the personal events that happened in my life at an early age. Although I was never in immediate danger at the time living in east county of San Diego growing up, seeing the smoke and then the sky turn a completely different color was an experience within itself. Schools and even some businesses closed solely due to the smoke making it hard to breath. So, in a way the film made me thankful for never having to experience the reality of the effects of fire damage, but it also made me more weary as it brought the “human” aspect of things to the climate crisis—something that is often looked at through the lens of scientists or experts. You were able to really feel the sentiments of the people in the documentary and how it affected people on a personal level aside that brought immense depth to various reports of damages to personal belongings and home loss.

While I understand that “Fire in Paradise” does not purposefully focus on the climate crisis, it definitely provides important context for the immediacy of it’s effects. The documentary not only described the devastating power of the forces of nature such as fierce winds, massive flames, and seemingly unstoppable and unending bursts of embers but also illustrated how unprepared we are at various levels. Not only were local authorities unequipped to properly handle an evacuation at the scale of that which was needed in Paradise, but dispatchers had inaccurate information, alert systems were incomplete, and even statewide entities such as Cal Fire weren’t able to utilize some of their most emportant countermeasures such such as air support to halt the flames while they had the chance. 
        <br><br>


On the other hand, from personal experience I believe that the Paradise Fire illustrates a factor that is arguably more important when considering the climate crisis from a culturally-centered perspective. In addition to being a Northern California native myself, I have family friends who were working for Cal Fire when the Paradise fire hit. Additionally, I have former classmates from gradeschool who were in college at Chico State when it happened. Talking to so many people who have been very personally affected by the fire, I was actually shocked in a positive way. I heard amazing stories of civilians assisting in evacuations (much like the hospital situation discussed in the documentary) as well as countless people contributing to volunteer efforts and generate donations for shelters, responders, and people who had lost their homes. More recently, as Ken discussed in his intro, there are similar efforts going on in response to the Australian Wildfires. While some may argue that there is little hope for us if we only respond when things reach crisis levels, I believe that the observable care and energy that people have shown in times of crisis warrants hope for the future. The biggest question, though, is how to mobilize that care earlier.

As I watched this film, I really do not question why Ken included it in the course, as he mentions we might in this video. I feel like the film does a very good job at portraying one of the most relevant consequences of climate change for us, the residents of California. I feel like wildfires are a consequence of climate change that really affect the daily lives of Californians, as it is something that happens often here and every time is worse. Recently, all of us UCSB students were affected by wildfires. At the end of last quarter, right before Thanksgiving, a fire set up on the mountains of Santa Barbara. Classes were cancelled for students and therefore our lives were directly affected. I feel like it is important for us to learn of this specific consequence of climate change because it has already began to affect our lives and will only continue to in the future, if we do not do anything about it.
        <br><br>
For me personally, watching this film was a little bit challenging. Throughout the whole film I was very emotional as to see the impacts of one of the worst fires to be seen in history. Growing up in San Diego, I was aware of wildfires and their severity, but I had never seen anything that depicted the facts of the events, and the emotions of those affected so well. Although it was rough to watch, it was really eye-opening to me to see how climate change is affecting thousands of people's lives now. Something that was specifically astonishing to me, was after watching the film when I became curious to see what the city of Paradise looked like today. I really was astonished to see that there has been basically no rebuilding done and the whole town still remains in ashes. This to me was just heartbreaking.

Watching the episode on the Campfire was very daunting and worrisome to see and listen to people’s experience and just how rapidly catastrophic this fire became. The fact that the fire could have been completely manageable to put out when it first started, as stated by the fireman, but was not accessible because of unsafe roads and unsafe winds for flight was unbelievable. It really put it into perspective for me that we do not realize just how extreme the consequences of climate change can go. This was the most destructive fire in California this century and it is concerning that we are only barely beginning to experience years and years of anthropogenic climate change. It will only get worse. We are already starting to see that in Australia as the wildfires have claimed 4 times as much as all 15 wildfires that have happened in California this century COMBINED. With 12 million acres on fire and counting and as more and more carbon dioxide is being released into the atmosphere, we must be reaching our tipping point at a much faster pace. We live in an area that is highly susceptible to forest fires, mudslides, drought and an area that has been affected so much by climate change compared to the rest of the United States already. How will this affect us and how soon?

The documentary "Fire in Paradise" brought back memories of when I was just an elementary school student where I witnessed the effects a fire first hand. Wearing a mask to school to safely breathe outside and seeing the amount of ash that falls from the sky is something I will remember for the rest of my life. The documentary did a great job capturing what occurred during the fire and shows how catastrophic and quickly fires can destroy land. I admittedly was confused as to why a single fire was relevant to the course relating to climate change, however after watching the video it became apparently clear. An increase in fires of this magnitude and greater and mind-boggling. The lack of warning is what I find the most concerning about all fires. Using real footage of the fire was alarming and served to show how frantic people are during an event such as the paradise fire. Its crazy that after growing up in California for my whole life that impacts of climate change are so evident and I had never been aware of the effect they were having on the state that I live in. Watching these documentaries on Kens channel and viewing the lectures in terrifying but eye opening to the change that needs to be made to keep fires from increasing in mass and destruction. 
        <br><br>

Something that stood out in particular after watching "Fire in Paradise" that Ken stated in his lecture was that the Thomas Fire was once the largest in California but was quickly surpassed by the Ranch Fire in. only half a year. I find it crazy that events like this that wreak such havoc on our California cities do not spark greater political debate in the country about how to effectively move forward in our struggle with the climate crisis.

It's so shocking to see how all these natural disasters are occurring in such a short time frame. The most appalling part of these disasters is the way in which people are framing this to be a partisan issue. California's "gross mismanagement" is only a tip of the iceberg in term of the framing of issues as imaginary or avoidable. Our country is polluting the planet faster than any other, but we still fail to claim responsibility for our gluttonous lifestyle. Only now are we starting to see the issues we have been predicting for so long manifest into something we are losing control of.

Watching the documentary on the fire in Paradise angered me. Everything that could have gone wrong did. There’s an idea about catastrophe known as the Swiss Cheese model where there’s multiple layers of defense in place, each defense with its own flaw. When all these holes/flaws line up, catastrophe hits. This is the case for Paradise. First the weather conditions, then PG&E not shutting off power, then CalFire not relaying the correct information, then the wrong choice of how to mandate evacuations, then the roads and gridlock, and the hospital, and the burning cars, and the firetrucks without much ability, and the overwhelming level of chaos and danger surrounding the entire situation. Everything went wrong. Each victim of that fire has every right to be angry at numerous organizations because they’re essentially all to blame in contributing to the massive destruction that took place. I especially was deeply angered by the choice of how to issue the mandatory evacuation notices, where they had 2 options and opted for one that would only notify those who had signed up for the notifications. While it is entirely possibly that I am misunderstanding the other option, I can’t help but believe that issuing the other notice, or even both methods, would have helped save a portion of the 85 lives lost to the fire. 
            <br><br>
        Lastly, going back to the idea of the Swiss Cheese model of catastrophe, it’s becoming clearer that our layers of defense have become antiquated with climate change bringing about things humans, and especially human civilization, have never seen before. Our systems applied to natural disasters that were more “natural” rather than influenced by what we have done to our environment. They no longer apply. Our evacuation plans no longer apply, as seen in Paradise where zones became obsolete and even escaping per vehicle quickly became a deadly pursuit as people had to run for their lives on foot. Climate change has made a new world and we can’t continue operating and assuming that this isn’t new territory.

As someone who has lived in Northern California for the entirety of my life, this film hit close to home. (Literally). I have had friends evacuated out of their homes during the Santa Rosa fires, and seen first hand the major devastations that a fire can cause. I found myself in tears multiple times while watching this film. I believe that it did an incredible job highlighting the major role climate change played in the severity of this fire. Due to weather changes, rain began coming much later in Northern California,  increasing and prolonging the fire season. This would not be the case without climate change. I began seeing the effects of climate change through these fires. From seeing my friends neighborhood burn down in Santa Rosa, to having school closed for days due to the severity of the smoke in my home town, I have been living through the effects of climate change for some time now. 
            <br><br>

"Human caused climate change has doubled the amount of wild fires since 1984 across Western US." This was the quote which stuck with me. The severity of these fires would not be the way they were, without the warming of our area. These extra hot, extra dry summers are only going to get worse. For those in Northern California, whether or not climate change is real should not be a question. We have all seen it. We have all lived through it. Every person in my area knows at least one other human who's life has been changed by these fires. The question should be: what do we do now? Of course, action regarding the climate must be done. We must speak with our local governors, we must vote in our local polls; we must take action. Along with this, new safety precautions need to be implemented. I know for a fact that my hometown is not prepared for a major fire. However, every summer we are at an extreme risk, as most of the land around our neighborhoods is dry open space. We need to take action politically, and we need to take action around safety as well.

While watching the film "Fire in Paradise" I couldn't help but feel so heartbroken and fearful the entire time. Before i watched the film I was talking to my housemates about it and and they were very interested so we all watched it together. This film was terrifying, the amount of times we were brought to tears or had chills run through our body in under an hour spoke for itself. Within 18 hours an entire community burned to the ground and there was no viable way to escape, the people were told basically to accept their fate and to just lie on the ground and pray. When we were watching the interview segments with those in the leadership positions that day you can see and hear the pain in their eyes and through their words as they speak about it. One of the parts that stuck with me the most was when the two women who worked at the school had to make the decision to get on the bus with all of the children knowing there was no opportunity for them to return to their own homes and try to grab any of their personal belongings. The only part of this documentary that needed a change, was a little bit more detail on the "why" this is happening. Nothing too lengthy that would take away from the devastation these people faced, but when one of the fire rescuers mentioned that these fires "are not normal" it would have been a good touch to add a quick why because the people that watch this who don't understand the severity of our climate crisis can then connect these two events in their heads moving forward. Besides that I think this documentary displays the horror that these natural disasters are capable of. 

            <br><br>

I was born in Sydney Australia, my dads side of the family lives there right now. It is so sad that my home country where half of my family resides has been on fire for months. Close to 1 BILLION animals have died along with people as well. These fires are not normal and I just do not understand how politicians and people of power can look at these incidents and turn a blind eye to the factors that are causing them. Places, animals, and people are burning, yet that doesn't seem to be enough to make changes. It is frustrating and horrific to watch these things happen when we have the wrong people in power knowing damn well they aren't going to do anything about it.

"Fire in Paradise" shocks me by bringing me close to what was happening that day. Under an hour, the whole town became what I imagine as hell should look like, smoke covered the sky blocking all the sunlight, flaming red everywhere and embers blew all over the place by wind. It’s also heartbreaking to hear the story of people who lost their family in that fire.
             <br><br>
The tragedy happened as if it was only because of the mistakes made by authorities, companies, and even residents accumulated over the years. It wouldn’t happen if PG&E decided to shut down the power that day and proceeded maintenance; If authorities foresaw the necessity of funding to build more evacuating roads; If the 911 lines could decide to confirm the fire was actually far away from town; If all residents signed up for the emergency alert, maybe we wouldn’t lose 85 lives in that tragic. But there are too many if’s, and there is nothing for us to do to change the ending. 
            <br><br>
 But it isn’t just the faults of a flawed social structure and lack of preparations. Climate change created the necessary conditions to create a wild-fire that exceeded expectations from them all. Increased temperature, lack of rains and dryness, a day that is uncommonly windy, made up that black swan event. 
            <br><br>
What really scared me was: even under dangers that are as obvious and common as wild-fires, large companies like PG&E are willing to risk at high costs to violate the safety guidelines, in order to gain some profits. We have to realize how slow and unaffected climate change does seem to most people. If companies like PG&E says “It is OK to not replace the aging equipment since it’s unlikely for a large scale wild-fire to occur”. Then imagine even today a lot of people are still under the impression that we are secured from climate change. Some even have the thoughts “climate change is fake”. Just how many violations there were had been made over the years by other companies, industries to profit, which mainly cause climate change? How many of them are still happening right now?

The PBS documentary, “Fire in Paradise”, was both terrifying and emotional.  Seeing how fast situations can change for the worst truly puts into perspective not only the individually horrific incidents we face now, like the fire in Paradise, but also the big picture fight we face all around the globe: climate change.  As I was watching the film, a couple of questions came to mind: could they have given a warning to the town instead of evacuating all zones suddenly? Could there have been anything done differently to reduce the fatalities?  When looking at it from a realistic perspective, the answer (personally) is no.  We are human, and just as we did not expect to anthropogenically speed an already changing climate, no one could have expected the intensity and momentum of the Camp Fire.  Moving at 80 football fields a minute and eventually covering the size of Chicago, this incident that should have not been as big of a deal as it was became seared in the memories of the 50,000 people who managed to escape - but also ended up being the last memory made for 85 people.  No matter how crazy the statistics of the fire are, nothing was more impactful to me than seeing the vigor of the fire contrasted to how serene Paradise once was.  Mixed with personal accounts, the documentary was a true tearjerker, and makes the overlying crisis less impersonal and puts it into perspective.  Not only will the altering climate worldwide affect the earth’s ecosystem from a scientific point of view, but it has a sentiment attached to it as it kills all types of species - including humans.  But not just humans in general - our grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, neighbors.  It is happening and needs to be addressed.
            <br><br>
 Watching the evacuation of the hospital was frightening.  I imagined the panic of the staff and patients.  What about the mothers giving birth?  The people in the middle of a surgery? Those on life support?  Our planet is also on life support. Just as it feels to watch the fire creeping closer and closer while trying to evacuate your hometown, we need to feel the same alarm at the fire that is climate change, inching closer and closer until it is impossible to put out.

While the documentary was definitely a tear jerker and I agree with many of your points, I can't help but feel a bit mad while watching all of it unfold. Americans are so quick to feel pity and sadness for people who lose everything to natural disasters... when it is the upper class in the U.S. .Entire documentaries are made about the loss of a so-called "paradise" , but what about the places that are not so paradise. Why are we not seeing the documentaries about low income families getting effected by the fires, or why aren't we seeing the vast tragedies that effect countries like India, where the effects of America's massive carbon footprint hits harder than places like paradise. Sure it is astonishing to see a beautiful middle class place being taken down by fires, but there are also millions of places experiencing the exact same thing with no coverage because nothing of "beauty" was lost. Suburbia is burning, but so are the low income families.
<br><hr>
The evacuation of the hospital was frightening when watching the documentary, you can see the confusion and anguish on everyone’s faces. People being removed from the hospital directly from their beds and some in wheelchairs shows how unprepared the city was for a fire spreading at such a rapid rate. Even more frightening was watching the cars stuck on the roads surrounded with fire engulfed cars and trees.

The film "Fire in Paradise" is a documentary that focuses on the dangers of wild fires during our ever growing climate crisis. The film focuses specifically on the Camp Fire which occurred in Paradise California in November of 2018. The Paradise Camp Fire was the most destructive and deadly fire of all time in California History, taking up to 85 lives and destroying up to 18,000 homes and buildings. The majority of the film focuses on playing out the events of the Camp Fire in real time chronologically. Interviews with citizens and local officials paired with real footage of the fire before, during, and after, help portray how destructive and dangerous this fire was and how dangerous one can be. This film also highlights the chaos that comes with a natural disaster of such high level. The film gives a in-depth look on how many evacuation plans and escape routes were clogged or ended up failing because of a lack of preparation. Later in the film the documentary shifts more towards an outlook on how this could've been prevented. The cause of the fire PG&E who's power line failed which eventually led to vegetation fire is discussed and and much of the blame is put on PG&E. I believe this blame is worthy and to be honest I don't think PG&E and other power companies are being held accountable enough when their outdated equipment is to blame. Furthermore, the company knew there was a high chance of such an incident occurring and chose to do nothing about it. I believe this all goes along with all that we have seen already in climate crisis. Many people on this planet ignoring health concerns and other issues that are harming to our planet in turn to make a profit or fulfill their own interests first, at the cost of our planet.

Watching the film “Fire in Paradise” left me with a lot of questions and feeling horrible for the community of Paradise. My biggest frustration is the whole "new alert system code red," and how it wasn't used because "no one was waiting around to send out alerts." However, only half the town was registered for the new system, some of those on the alert system didn't receive a warning, and I feel that if there was an effort to send police units out to knock on people's doors, then there was definitely time to send more alerts. There was just a disconnect of information from the start. 
            <br><br>
Second, the officials denied to comment on and/or denied the idea that there could've been an evacuation fire, but I feel some empathy for this critique as it seemed that everyone was caught off guard. Most frustrating, though, was PG&E's response to the whole situation. As the film points out, PG&E commits safety violations, goes on probations and then violates those probation; and if the corporation was a person, that person would be in jail right now. Denying and ignoring prior warning of possible equipment failure and deciding on the solution of just shutting off power on red flag days, is the type of behavior that will continue to cause destruction in our planet's time of high wind, high temperature and late rains. 
            <br><br>
This reminds me of the recent evacuation in Goleta back in November or December. I was just shopping in the Fairview area as the fire broke out. Two concerns in that experience– 1. I live here and did not get any emergency updates but my boyfriend who was visiting with the same carrier who lives in the Bay Area got all the emergency alerts 2. The traffic at the gas station we were at as people got the evacuation order quickly broke out in chaos as people were freaking out and yelling at people who didn't pull up fast enough, for example. Information and having/knowing plan to stay focused and calm (as much as we can) are the two important things our communities should focus on as the threat of more consequences from climate change are here and progressing.

This film was extremely emotionally overwhelming to watch (i think i cried during most of the film honestly). My heart breaks for everyone who was affected by the Camp fire. It's crazy how pretty much everything that could have gone wrong went wrong--from PG&E's decision to not turn off the transmission line to lack of roads to exit the city. In section we talked a lot about how it goes to show that we are simply not prepared to deal with the impending disasters of the climate crisis. I remember I saw an article recently where a firefighter just straight up said they wouldn't be able to handle the fires at all. As it gets windier, hotter, and drier we are only going to see more and more fires start unfortunately and it's terrifying to think of. Last October, a fire broke out in my hometown (46 Fire in Jurupa Valley, CA) and my parents and other family members had to evacuate because it was so close. I remember feeling so upset because I was so far from my family and I was unable to be there with them or help in any way. it was nowhere nearly as destructive as the Camp fire, but it's disheartening to know that this has become our new normal. It was also interesting to notice how a lot of the city's focus is on "how can we better deal with the next fire" rather than "what can we do what can we change to do our part in solving the climate crisis and prevent more disasters." It's putting a band aid on this huge gushing wound (I remember someone in section said this).

"Putting a band aid on this huge gushing wound" is a great way to put the situation - the Camp Fire is just one manifestation of the larger climate crisis. Its crazy that these fires can be our new reality, along with many other issues coming in many other forms. A humongous fire being started by a simple human mistake not to turn off the transmission line is absurd, but sadly our new reality. Unfortunately, unlike some of the people who were cautious enough to spend up to $100,000 to protect their land, the PG&E Corporation was not nearly as cautious, causing major destruction to the community of Paradise. Furthermore, they were not even held as nearly as accountable as they should have for all the destruction caused. 
            <br><br>
I sympathize with Dania's feelings about her situation, as it must be so terrible being helpless when your family is in danger. And the danger is real, which is what the Camp Fire showed. From communicating the danger of a fire to actual evacuation, Paradise was a disaster. The time is now to do something about this and make sure we are better prepared for future disasters like this, while taking action to prevent our climate from creating more disasters like this - not simply "putting a band aid on this huge gushing wound."

I am ashamed to admit it--but until this film I never understood the severity of the Paradise fires that took place last year. My hometown is less than two hours from Paradise and I used to compete in swim meets in Gridley and towns near Paradise. It is crazy when catastrophic events don’t directly affect us--we tend not to care. However, after absorbing information from these first few weeks of class, I have come to the realization that all of these dangerous climate events affect us directly. These wild weather patterns are a result of human action. 

            <br><br>

Many scenes had me shook in this documentary. For instance, the embers that were bold and visibly blaring an orange-red hue all over the screen as if it were a snow blizzard but in reality it was a fire blizzard. I cannot imagine the fear and panic the town of Paradise felt when they had minimal time to evacuate and leave their town behind to burn.

            <br><br>

I also thought it was exceptionally kind and hopeful that so many hospital workers, nurses, and doctors offered up their car seats to patients to get everyone out of danger. This kind of evacuation was not one they had really practiced for--who would practice that?

            <br><br>

This all brings it back to the beginning of the video with the interviewees answering the filmmakers questions: The first man being interviewed states that these circumstances were not unprecedented and this type of wild weather could have been expected taking previous patterns and our human impact into account. This is contrasted with the fire fighters response of “I’m not going to answer that question” when asked if they should have envisioned this [fire] happening. This is exactly the issue--there is a divide in the population among people who understand that human impact and data shows that we should expect wild weather and be prepared for it AND of course take action to improve our choices and impact versus the people who do not want to take any responsibility for our actions and refuse to answer questions that would force them to dig deeper into why this problem even arose.

The film "Fire in Paradise" does an incredible job of showing how the Campfire grew so out of control, the multitude of factors that contributed to the severity of the fire and how people were affected by the horrible tragedy. The Campfire was one of the deadliest in California history and was agitated due to conditions on the day of the fire that were ultimately caused by climate change. The extreme drought and high winds along with a negligent power company were the main causes for the severity of the fire. It also seemed like there was a lack of communication and urgency during the beginning of the fire. People who live in California are relatively used to fires so authorities and residents were not too concerned at first; ultimately though the fire ended up spreading faster and farther than anticipated causing many to loose their lives. Evacuation procedures seemed to go up in flames as Paradise did, as people franticly evacuated the hospital using their own vehicles to transport patients. Getting to see the individuals impacted but the fire was extremely impactful. Hopefully in the future people don't underestimate the growing danger of fires as climate change continues to increase their severity.

The documentary "Fire in paradise" captures the moment when a huge forest fire managed to consume an entire town. This resulted in the evacuation of around 50,000 people; whom of which would return back to their non-existent homes. This really hit me hard in the sentimental sense. During the film, I would imagine my neighbors' home, my friends' home and my home simply not being there anymore. Imagining this just in my head anguished me. People with established lives undergo suffering due to the perfect conditions that allowed the fires in paradise  to maximize their ability for destruction. 
            <br><br>
The equipment malfunction, the severe drought and the high winds is what made this extreme case. Then again, the obviously changing climate has to have something to do with it as well. There can be no debate that with the slight warming of the entirety of the planet, there will be changes to every day weather. as such a complex system weather is, it can be exacerbated with just a slight tweak. This change of the everyday norm will change natural events be it for worse or better. In the case of wild fires, it is apparently becoming worse.
            <br><br>
The officials in charge when there is emergency on the rise should be competent. It seems that the people in charge managed to make even more chaos when paradise was heading towards disaster. There should a better way. No matter how you cut the future, it is still unknown. You NEED TO prepare for it to the best of your knowledge.

The documentary “Fire in Paradise” was a very interesting film to say the least. I was born and raised in California and have lived here my entire life so I am familiar with California fires but I have never experienced anything as wild and fast spreading as the fire depicted in the film. It is very scary and worry some that in present times there is possibility of fires that can destroy entire cities in under 5 hours and create massive destruction the size of Chicago. One of the most worry-some parts of the whole film was the fact that these people were caught by surprise. The high winds combined with a dry environment caused embers to be thrown side ways making the fire spread in multiple different directions so quickly that even the planning authorities had done in case of a big fire were not able to be implemented. People were stuck in traffic trying to escape, no one knew how bad the fire actually was because firefighters had the sole goal of trying to help people escape. It is simply terrifying to know that this is possible and it can happen here in my home of California. We need to find solutions and have better preparation so that if something like this happens again we can be ready.

Watching the film, Fire in Paradise,  it made me realize that this is the harsh reality we are living today. A reality in which the fires in California are a normal occurrence. The film made me feel frustrated that the cause of the fire was a malfunction in the PG&E electricity tower. Seeing the magnitude of the cloud of smoke above the canyon fire made it appear to be that from a scene of the apocalypse. Overall the clips of the houses burning and the red lights coming from the burning trees shows the intensity of the issue with fires in California. The film mentioned that it only took 4 hours for the town of paradise to burn down and that is a fact that haunts me. A small town named Paradise filled with many people and memories went up in flames and destroyed all that people could remember in less than 4 hours. I feel like this is going to be a very common trend. A trend where cities and towns end up destroyed because of the changing of climate and company issues such as oil spills and PG&E electric malfunctions.

I think that the video “Fire in Paradise” may have been one of the most important videos I have seen about climate change to date. While the video mostly shows just what happened to the city of Paradise and its surrounding areas, I believe that this video’s true message is to show the true effect of our changing climate. I believe that most people do not want to make a change until they are either forced to or they do it out of fear for either themselves or their loved ones. 
            <br><br>

 Of course there was a variety of factors as to why the fire spread in the way that it did as well as the devastation it caused. But the fire may not have even happened if people had taken into account the changing climate and the effect that it would have on an area where fires have always been a likely occurrence. Another reason why it had gotten so out of hand was because of the misinformation about the size of the fire, people did not have enough time to evacuate. The people of Paradise had no idea what was coming so they paid an even heavier price then they probably should have. Climate change can make disasters like this worse because these events are unlike anything we as a species have ever seen before. Unfortunately, this may mean that the fire in paradise will not be the last time we see of these types of disasters.

Woah. I have heard the statistics of the campfire before, I knew how intense it was, but seeing it in film really puts it in perspective. I was not aware that it happened so quickly, around 4 hours. Hearing everyone's personal stories really realized it.
            <br><br>

Although in certain ways officials could have done more, it seems that many were doing far more than their jobs, for instance Joe was flipping burning vehicles with a backhoe, and worked for 24 hours straight. The plan of evacuation did not work in a timely fashion but that is because this large of a fire spreading at this incredible speed is extremely unpredictable, and extremely heightened due to climate change and climate unpredictability. 
            <br><br>

That being said, PG&E is to blame for not updating their system. PG&E also caused the Mendocino Complex fire that burnt down many homes in my hometown, including mine. PG&E has suffered minimal consequences which is extremely disappointing to say the lease.

The 2018 wildfire in Paradise has aroused many commentaries locally and globally and I believe that this is a great prove to the existence of climate crisis. As Ken describes that in the previous year people in California worried about the sea-level rises as they are close to the coastal lines,  the climate issues have always been in discussion. But nowadays, it is quite strange that California has experienced unexpected rising temperatures and unprecedented climate change that increase the odds of wildfire and other side effects in agriculture and daily life. The film utilizes a great technique that is to interview the frontline of Paradise wildfire, including firefighters and normal civilians. To be honest, it is quite scary to see some of the clips of the wildfire and I felt lucky that I wasn't there or even came to the U.S until Fall 2019. However, what I realized from what Ken told me in his first-week video and the first-week reading was that the climate crisis is originated globally and expressing its impacts globally. It is possible that the unusually large wind pattern originated from Colorado is a long-repressed burst caused by the increased amount of CO2 that is put into the atmosphere by all humanity. This helps me relate to the climate crisis again to Ken's illustration of smoking. There are so many similarities which the impact of climate change spoils on not only nearby but also all people on the planet. As the chief of the fire station in Paradise mentioned that "there is no way for us to evacuate all residents at the same time;, it is not because we don't want to but we  just can't." This reminds me that if there is one day that there is no time delay to the climate crisis and if all of the cumulated amounts of CO2 just pass their influence at once, is there anywhere for us to hide? The influence of climate change is definitely globally and even if we don't see it, it doesn't mean that one day it won't come and when it is the day, it will be catastrophic for all of us. I am certain that there won't be and there will not be a chance for the continuity of humanity. It just makes me feel so pessimistic. It may sound like moral kidnapping to call for all to change and react so I won't and I will use my learnings to influence as many as I can starting with my family and hopefully when all of us place the climate crisis as the priority, it is not too late.

When I heard people talking about how beautiful Paradise was and how much its people loved it, I started to be saddened and even wanted to cry because we all know what would happen later. I love how the director makes the comparison between Paradise before the fire and it after the fire, this left a deep impression for me. I have never encountered any wildfire in person throughout my entire life, so I was shocked and terrified by how the town looked like after the fire. When I was watching Christina’s story and found that her mom didn’t evacuate with her, I literally said  “what” in front of the screen. However, I soon realized that what Christina’s mom did was somehow understandable though it’s not a wise decision at all. One thing very important said by Christina is that she thought they were going to be notified, but they didn’t. It’s logical that Christina’s mom didn’t believe the fire could be that bad and spread so fast since no one officially told them to leave. The fire in Paradise was caused by human factors, which is the thing that I felt so pity about because it was supposed to be able to avoid as long as PG&E fixed their aged cables in time. We need to learn something from the fires happened in the past, and with the increasing temperature here, the risk of having fires will definitely increase. The government should be prepared so we won’t lose that many people again as in the Camp Fire.

Fire in parade is a documentary with a full sense of reality. It has not only the interleaving and playback of the original pictures, but also the subsequent interviews and recordings of firefighters, town residents and police. The documentary, which is just 50 minutes long, once again reappears the tragic scene of the fire to the audience, and lets people witness the deterrent force of nature again. From the hope that we can rely on human resources to solve the mountain fire, to the face of the harsh challenges of nature, people have no choice but to accept, pray for God's blessing, and finally have to flee completely in order to survive.
            <br><br>

There are three questions that we need consider in details. The first one is that in the face of all kinds of natural disasters, what attitude should people take? From this work, we can clearly see that many people (even the fire alarm center) are not enough to predict the harm of the fire, they are perfunctory, and finally face the facts. Therefore, for human beings, any natural disaster should not be underestimated and must be seriously faced and dealt with. The second question is that in the face of all kinds of natural disasters, how should people save themselves? There are two answers for this question: (1) We should contact the agency in time to control the harms of the disaster. (2) If the first option fails to be implemented successfully, we need to review the situation and quickly find alternative solutions. If there is no choice, we must evacuate from the disaster site as soon as possible. The third question is that After facing all kinds of natural disasters, how should people face new life? To be honest, it's hard to start again?! It's OK to say that we can fight again, but mentally, how to "repair"? Can those rambling lies of masseuse really heal people's psychological trauma? Don't bullshit. In addition to "eloquence", this profession is "nothing comes out of nothing". In the end, there is only time to heal the mind, and only time has such a chance to erase the trauma in people's hearts.
             <br><br>

These are three things that I thought when l was watching this movie.  Maybe different people will have different opinions to those questions, but the disasters are truly existing. These are inevitable truth. People cannot run away, the only thing we can do is that keep positive and try our best to prevent or solve.

As humans, we have this misconception that events and misfortunes that affect others don't or won't affect us as individuals. We believe that for one reason or another we are are not in danger of being put under the same circumstances. Unfortunately, this is how many if not most of us think until something horrible hits us right in the face without warning. For the residents of Paradise, the campfire of 2018 was their wake up call.  
            <br><br>

Climate change affects each and every living thing on the planet in many ways and forms. Many incidents that were once considered ‘natural disasters’ are not so ‘natural’ anymore. Human-caused climate change has doubled fires across the western United States. Prolonged drought combined with high winds and temperatures is causing some of the most destructive and largest fires in history. 
            <br><br>

The documentary featured several survivors from the campfire and their stories from that day. The personal story that made me the most emotional was Jordan’s. She mentions her granddad who lived in Concow. He was a sweet old man who lived on a small farm and grew pumpkins for his grandchildren to carve in Halloween. At the end of the documentary, I was very sad to find out he burned alive during the fire in his wheelchair, in his home alone, with a hose in his hand. I began to tear up as Jordan narrated the events.

Watching Fire In Paradise made me extremely upset because I saw people who were helpless and stuck in basically Hell. It is similar to the situation happening in Australia where many animals and people lost their homes due to an untamable wildfire. I cannot imagine how afraid the residents were. One part that made me emotional was when Kristine, a citizen of Paradise, left her mother when evacuating because she did not want to go. Another part that made me pretty sad was when the nurse was stuck and called her husband to save her. It took me by surprise that the town of Paradise had a plan to evacuate if a fire erupted, however, that plan became overwhelmed by the circumstances. The fire went seven and half miles in an hour so it is a bit understandable why things got out of control. The part that got me emotional was when a woman called 911 for help and the operator was telling her to get out, but she couldn’t. The phone went dead and most likely the woman on the other side of the phone call didn’t make it alive.
            <br><br>
This film broke my heart and was probably the worst film I’ve seen yet that has been assigned because of the way it made me feel. I felt guilty that I couldn’t help these people from burning alive and suffering. I pray that the families recover and can find a new home. 85 people perished in the Camp fire and the majority were elderly so that made it even sadder. They were probably unable to move fast out of their home or vehicle and burned alive. Tens of thousands of people were affected by this fire and I blame the police and fire department for not having a better plan of evacuation. They said that they did good but I disagreed because many people died and they said “it could have been worse.” In my opinion, PG&E should be held accountable and should be sued by all the families that lost loved ones and their homes. It was there powerline that caused the fire and they violated safety guidelines plenty of times. If PG&E was a person, and not a corporation, they would be in prison by now. I hope justice is served and everyone who is responsible for this wildfire is put behind bars or pays up the 10.5B in damages.

The video clips in the film really shocked me. Especially around halfway through the film, people were driving on the road, and fire would be just at the edge of the road. I cannot imagine what I would feel if I was in the situation. I can’t believe that the fire spread so rapidly that people did not even have the time to react before they realized it got dangerously close.
            <br><br>
I come from Taiwan, a little tropical island in East Asian, where the high humidity prevents any wildfires. I never fully understood the vastness and destructiveness of wildfires until I learned about them through the news in recent years. 
            <br><br>
This made me think that there are statistics and evidence that show that climate change is tied to the increased number of fires, but there is not a bigger discussion about it. People think “that will never happen to my town” or “the firefighters will take care of it somehow”, but the power of nature will always be greater than the power of mankind, as nature is what gave rise to the existence of humans.

I also come from South East Asia, so I also have never personally understood the effects of such fires. I think this is what makes it especially shocking for the both of us whilst watching this film. I've had many conversations with countless friend's that I've made while coming to school here, most of whom are from California and have had to face evacuations themselves. I couldn't possible imagine losing everything in a matter of hours. Watching the documentary made me extremely anxious, especially seeing that at one point they were essentially trapped with no where to go. It was so incredibly hard for me to put myself in that situation, as a kid, adult or elderly. It was also very saddening to see how little control firefighters had over the situation. At a point, there's not much more that they can do. This is was makes the situation so terrifying to me. Whenever I've studied disasters in the past, fires have not been a large part of that conversation. But after watching this documentary, I think that it is so so important to learn how destructive they are. We need to start paying attention to climate change, because REAL people are suffering, and just because it doesn't happen to us, doesn't mean that we should not take the situation as seriously as it deserved to be taken.

The beginning of the film was a great introduction to the speed at which the fire spread. It showed accounts of fire fighters and first responders who were working on the night the fire started. The documentary did a great job at showcasing the danger of this fire, mainly how no one was aware that it would become the most dangerous fire. One scene in the movie was an interview with a woman who was taking calls about fire sightings that night, she explained how shocked she was that every time she answered the phone she was hearing people telling her where they were seeing flames, and they kept moving closer to the city of Paradise. Very quickly she explained she was getting calls about people telling her the flames were in their backyards. 
            <br><br>

Beyond giving a great description, this documentary was very good at pulling emotions from viewers by interviewing teachers who had to flee the school with children in the school bus. The filmmakers interviewed people who were stuck in traffic waiting for a way to escape. Towards the middle of the documentary people had to abandon their cars because they were surrounded on all sides by fire, they were stuck in a building in the middle of the flames, essentially left to suffocate or burn. Luckily these people all survived but it showed the great dangers all of us could be in here in California. It also shows that we are already suffering the consequences of climate change and none of us are immune to danger, no matter where we live or our financial means.

After watching the film “Fire in Paradise”, it is the first time that I feel a fire is close to my life. The fire is so real and I was totally shocked that I finish watching the documentary.  However, this tragedy is nonsense to me. Hardly could I believe a fire department failed to report this disaster. So, when fire came, people didn’t have much time to leave that area. People should learn from tragedy like this to prevent it from happening again. 
            <br><br>

What’s more, the human activities such as traffic have cause 2.5 degree of temperature rise in the area of California. This is only one factor of that fire. The constant of drought, the high speed of wind are also two factors that combine causing this disaster. As the lecture told us that there has been 20 large fire that happened in 21st century in California. Fire department should constantly overwatch those fire in order to prevent more fire from happening.

Although this disaster was the result of a long history of climate change and environmental neglect, I agree with you on the fact that this fire was caused partially by a concoction of different variables. For example, the police department was doing everything they could to give the residents of Paradise the information they needed regarding evacuation, but the fire department could not relay the updated information due to their prioritization of rescuing civilians in the Concow area. This massive episode of miscommunication caused many families their homes, and in some cases, the lives of their loved ones.
            <br><br>


If corporations like PG&E were to take climate change more seriously, then perhaps this entire situation could have been avoided. They knew that the conditions in the are were perfect for a fire to break loose, yet they still neglected to shut the power down (which was running through 100 year old power lines). Had PG&E been coherent enough to shut down the power (and maybe even replace some of their equipment), hundreds of acres of land and wildlife could have been saved.

It was a little hard to watch how the fire was spreading so rapidly and how people had so little control over it. As someone in the film said, your mind just doesn't want to picture what has happened. It is shocking how destructive and terrible these fires are and how much damage they have caused not only to the city and the environment, but also to people's lives and families.
            <br><br>
I think this terrible situation that people have lived through has taught some a lesson of what climate change is really about: the catastrophes all around the world and the devastation they cause. It is important to know the consequences of climate change since when we realize the scale of such events, we can better understand the importance of preventing them in the future.
            <br><br>
However, I don't agree with the blame that has been put on PG&E, a private company that is driven to get profit. In this situation, I think the more important issue is the American culture of pursuing wealth, capital, and material success. In my opinion, this culture of always wanting more has been ingrained in people's minds, and it is the problem that we will have to solve first in order to stop climate change. For me, this seems very unlikely at this point since so many people are involved in such lifestyle, but I still want to stay positive and hope that our true nature will take over soon.

The documentary “Fire in Paradise” put the horror of wildfires into perspective for me. I’ve never been seriously threatened by a fire before, and on this campus, the fires are even often the butt of  joke about whether or not finals will be cancelled. I was in tears throughout most of this film, and in complete shock at learning about the devastating effects of the camp fire. 
            <br><br>

What made this documentary so effective for me was the interviews throughout. Hearing about the loss, fear, and devastation that so directly affected people broke my heart. I know it seems so obvious, but it took me actually hearing it from their mouths to think deeply about how awful these fires are.
             <br><br>

I think that if I was someone who was questioning the validity of climate change, this documentary wouldn’t exactly sway me. I would probably end up just blaming PG&E and the natural dry season. That would be my only qualm with the film, however, I know that wasn’t the point. The point was to show how awful the fire was, not to convert climate change deniers/questioners.




</p><hr>



<p>
This film's personal focus on the people effected most by the fire was, what I believe, the most impactful element of the film. Rather than tackling climate change from a detached perspective through statistics and forecasts, this film shows how climate change devastates communities and people. I think this is an important insight as the effects of climate change is so obvious and terrifying that anyone can see it if they care to look. Having grown up in Florida, I frequently experienced hurricanes and tropical storms. Locals seemed almost proud of their ability to withstand and endure these storms. However, after ominous Hurricanes such as Irma and its indisputable connection to climate change , I noticed locals becoming more worried about the increasing intensity of such storms. Just as the campfire in the film, Irma and other powerful storms serve as active illustrations and reminders that climate change is happening. 

             <br><br>

How little the firefighters could do about this situation was also shocking to me. For some reason, I didn't imagine wild fires as being on the same level as devastation as other natural disasters. This film has changed that preconception. Despite the fact that the fire was directly caused by human activity and decision making, humans could do almost nothing to stop it once it got started. The film says the fire was distinguished by rain. This reminded me of the Santa Barbara fire last year near thanksgiving. When I was biking back to my dorm at Santa Catalina, I could see a spot of orange and correctly assumed it was a fire in the mountains. I later saw it spread across the mountain range is a fairly rapid speed. It feels like we got lucky that it rained because the fire was seemingly spreading despite human efforts.

The film highlighted the certainty of climate change and how it is affecting our lives. Wildfires are becoming a norm in California but not too long ago, they happened once every couple of years. The fire department and emergency officials have never dealt with a fire of that magnitude. It was able to cover so much in a small amount of time. Covering mountains in a matter of hours and creating smoke that covered the sky, making the day turn into night. The video showed several people escaping the fire and sadly those who were unable. This film was truly depressing and I can't imagine how those affected by the fire must feel. It shows that climate change is here and that we need to do something before another event happens. Wildfires have become so common, that when people see them on the news they don't even think of it twice. Some think it is a part of living in California but the issue needs to be addressed. What happened in Paradise shouldn't be allowed to happen again. The only way of trying to do something is confronting the crisis of climate change.

When watching the film "Fire in Paradise", I started having heavy flashbacks to where I was and what I was doing when the Paradise fire happened. Where I'm from, my hometown is only two hours away from Paradise, but we were still heavily affected by that fire. I can remember feeling that same panic that the people in the film were feeling, I can remember all of us in our town so nervous when thoughts began to pop up, such as, "Are the ashes going to land here? Is another fire going to happen here? If Sacramento is being alerted about the potential harm of the ashes and the smoke, do we have to worry too?" I can remember all the students, the teachers, and the parents protesting for our school district to cancel school because the air was terrible. I remember feeling my chest tightened and how hard it was for me to breathe as I walked to school a few days after the Paradise Fire. I remember all the events my high school's Kiwin's/Key Club did to raise awareness about the fires, collecting food, clothes, donations left and right so we can donate it to the area of Chico, which is one of the main cities helping those affected by Paradise. I remember the day when our Kiwin's adviser during our club meeting took out his phone, dialed the number to Paradise High School, and all we heard was not static, but the sounds of the roaring fire eating away at the phone. 
             <br><br>

I remember all those weeks all too well, and it will forever be part of my mind as I think about the climate crisis. And every time I hear someone deny that climate change exists or try to say that it has no affect on the wildfires, I just wanted to ask them, "Are you out of your mind?" But now, after watching the film, I just want to show every person who has denied climate change this film and Ken's video. Because these are two wonderful examples of just how much our abusive actions have caused such destructive events just like the Paradise Fire. We are the problem to the dry trees, the dry land, the lack of rain, the lack of humidity, the intensity of these fires. You can say that Mother Nature is causing this, but this is actually Mother Nature's response to our cruel actions.

Watching the documentary on the fire in Paradise filled my heart with grief. The residents of Paradise went through something no one should ever have to go through. 85 lives were taken because of an event caused by climate change. Being from northern California, I believe that the fire acted as a wake up call for a lot of people. People began to realize that climate change is real and it is happening locally. As mentioned in the documentary, officials in Paradise were not prepared for a fire that destructive, because they have never seen one that bad and couldn't anticipate it. A fire that fast and out of control was able to occur under the conditions of the dry land and extremely high winds. 
              <br><br>
This is the new normal for California. In order to ensure the safety of citizens, individuals need to make sure they are aware of evacuation plans in the case of an emergency. Cities must also make it a priority to update evacuation plans and procedures for their town so they are reliable during extreme situations. In order to prevent fires like this, PG&E needs to be held accountable. Being such a large company nationwide, they can afford to fix power lines before they are so old they malfunction and start fires. Stricter regulations should be put in place to fix this ongoing issue.

I 100% agree with you. Watching this documentary was very eye opening to me and forced me to acknowledge that these climate issues are not far away from us but are right here just a few hours from our homes. It saddens me that as Californians we have just accepted this as our new normal and almost expect a fire to occur at least once a year. It scares me to think that if we do not try to stop climate change in the very near future we likely will not have one at all. I agree with you that PG&E should be held accountable for this situation and not only that but large companies who contribute the most to climate change  (and CO2 emissions) should also be held accountable, especially now that these issues are becoming more and more prominent. Seeing as even though these Californian fires are only a fraction of what Australia is facing right now I can only pray that the global issue, that is climate change, is taken seriously and taken care of before it is too late for us all.

“Fire in Paradise” made me very emotional and angry for the victims of the fire. I came out of this documentary much more appreciative of our first responders who were on site during this fire. There were so many circumstances that led up to the catastrophic event which ultimately culminated in a tragedy of this magnitude. There was a false sense of security because no one had information- the fire outpaced all the resources the town had. With winds moving so quickly and roads blocked off, a lot of normal protocols couldn’t have been followed. The issue is, with climate change, this is the new normal. New protocols need to be issued and practiced because events like this are more likely to occur. 
             <br><br>

Although I was on campus for the Thomas Fire, the fire still felt so far away and foreign to me. This film brought the viewers face to face with the flames and has changed the way I view wildfires now. I am truly terrified and wondering what can be done at this point?

I am also shocked by that big fire. People should remember that horrible fire forever because it brings a big loss not only to those house owners but also to those wild animals and plants. What can we learn from that big fire? Climate change cause ignite everything easily. We humans consumer too much fossil fuels and release too much CO2 into atmosphere. I still remember a scene that touches me a lot in the video: people are watching their homeland burning but cannot do anything. These events are truly catastrophic. I am also emotional for victims in that big fire. I doubt why governments in the world still let the increase of global temperatures continue. Why environmental meetings in Kyoto and Paris cannot stop the increase temperatures?  Another tragedy happens in 2019: Australian big fire. Millions of wildlife animals suffer from this accident, and local ecosystems were destroyed severely. HOWEVER, their prime minister was in vocation in Hawaii. That’s really ridiculous, and I believe there are many officials like home in the world. We need them to wake up and do some practical things for saving the environment.

This documentary was heartbreaking, yet so upsetting because the severity of its outcomes could have been avoided. I firmly believe that our actions have significantly contributed to climate change and global warming, thus the human race has long contributed to making fires bigger and more frequent as well as other “natural disasters”. I am not saying we caused it but I do think that we have worsened these events due to continuous increase of greenhouse gases that reflect on the wind and unwanted temperatures, that not only affect our weather, but our communities and any sort of life around the world. The US has faced the worst fires in history in the last four years, but that is not it. Climate change is happening and if companies, such as PG&E, do not take responsibility fires like these will happen again and again. The fire in Paradise, which only took four hours to destroy the entire city, should serve as an example for us to learn and enforce new regulations for companies that might be jeopardizing the wellbeing of others, as well as we should implement new ways in which we rely more on renewable sources, rather than on oil companies.

“Fire in Paradise” was an extremely saddening film that introduced and educated individuals on the how a fire has spread over 8 miles and destroyed the town of paradise at an incredible speed. The power of wind is astonishing. Although the fire was caused by the PG&E electric company - through old equipment that  was brought down onto a power line and came in contact with a steel tower - the fire was spread in a blink of an eye. Climate change was definitely the reason the fire took off as fast as it did due to the high winds and dry climate due to the scorching high temperatures. It was even too windy to fly a helicopter to try and throw water onto the fire. Hearing the 9-1-1 calls were extremely nauseating and made me teary eyed when thinking of all the family who called before hand and were told they were safe. My heart hurts for the individuals who did not make it out in time. It was very heartbreaking and devastating to hear the voices of individuals trying to escape the town of Paradise. Overall, this documentary was an incredible film that allowed us to witness a disastrous event due to climate change instead of giving us factual evidence of what may potentially happen. I believe that each state should hold new regulations on these climate disasters in order to counter the risk of any catastrophe or wildfire. Their should be a Law that should require each and every family to provide a safety and evacuation plan. Each city should also host a mandatory meeting on which roads to escape from (in order to reduce traffic jam) and proper escape routines and necessities to carry. On top of that, the city should have funding in order to provide for the cities and individuals who do not have the means to provide for a disaster like this. It is so frightening to comprehend that we truly do not have control over the extent of how nature erupt.

Before watching the documentary, Its name has already brought resonance to my heart. I am an international student. I have been in Santa Barbara for almost three years. However, in these three years, I had been through two large wild fires which were called the Thomas Fire and another just happened few months ago. I witnessed all things happen- the college cancelled the classes when the fire was on. People living in the mountain areas were being called to evacuate from their houses. I remember the first year I came back to China, and I told my parents the place I live and study has the most beautiful sky, the nature within. I honestly feel grateful to live in such a place could be called "paradise". Even though here is not my home country, when I witnessed all things happening just around me and the fire tried to swallow up California's paradise.
             <br><br>
Through this documentary, I honestly think its a well-made one since the director used the first-person narration to tell us a real story behind the scenes. When a nature disaster comes to a place without any warning. People were terrified in tearing hurry. I actually got tears In my eyes while watching several clips like the doctors use their own vehicles trying to help their patients to evacuate first. Sometimes reality can be scarier than what the movie shows us. The film is also well done in making engagement and relate the wildfires with the academic side. The scientists, the government, different programs are reacting.

After watching "Fire in Paradise" I was left feeling very sad and angry. During the time that this horrific event was occurring I saw articles and clips on TV and online of all the destruction it was causing, but never truly realized the intense reality of how quickly peoples lives had changed in such a short amount of time. After viewing this documentary, I felt a sense of ignorance about how I had perceived this fire and the mass destruction it created. Hearing the personal stories and watching the whole town of Paradise become engulfed in flames throughout the documentary really hit me hard and I couldn't help but think of how helpless the people must have felt during that time. I also kept thinking about how easily this could have been my own town, as a lifelong resident of San Diego, I grew up aware of fire dangers and have been evacuated from my home multiple times. I think this documentary did a good job of giving statistics and facts about climate change/fires, but also made the viewer feel empathetic towards the residents of Paradise. 
             <br><br>

I also felt a sense of anger that we as a society and country have allowed climate change to progress to where it is now and that we are not treating is as the most urgent issue we are facing. Peoples lives have been lost, homes destroyed and there will continue to be even more devastating events unless we take immediate action. I cannot comprehend how many companies, politicians/government officials, and individuals are willing to call climate change a hoax in order to profit and continue to promote inaction when this is a worldwide issue that could very well have negative impacts on them longterm. 
             <br><br>

I believe that companies like PG&E who where aware that their equipment was faulty but did not want to invest in making it safer until an event (like a fire) made them, should be held responsible and that they need to take measures to prevent events like the Camp Fire from happening again. And what makes me even more frustrated is that these companies have the resources to prevent things like this from occurring but only look at the value and cost in the short term rather than long term in which they could potentially save money as well as lives, homes, and whole cities.

"Fire in Paradise" hits a sore spot for me because I know someone whose family was displaced in that fire. The film brought me back to last year when my friends and I watched in disbelief as a Californian town was burned off the map with 95% of its structures completely destroyed. the fact that this could happen in the richest state of the richest country in the world devastated our sense of security and motivated us to take this class to see exactly how far we were in the negative impacts of climate change.  This film gave a very detailed description of both the mental anguish of facing down an unstoppable hellstorm intent on devouring paradise and the academic reasons for why the fire was that bad in the first place. 

             <br><br>

Fighting fires is a lot like fighting a war you need a front line and you need the support companies to back up that front line in the form of air support or just making sure your frontline doesn't crumble to fatigue or the onslaught of 'enemy  fire' and to wrap it all up you need the logistics to keep all parts of you 'fire army' running smoothly paradise had none of these things. Help came late and when they got there they focused on evacuation there was no fighting just running and I think that foreshadows our future, soon we won't be able to fight the effects of climate change all we can do is run .

Seven-and-a-half miles from the town of Paradise, a fire had started beneath a high-voltage electricity tower. The line was almost 100 years old and was owned by PG&E, America’s largest electricity company. PG&E can turn off the electricity in power lines to reduce wildfire risk, but it did not. The fire is manageable at the beginning if firemen could get to it, but the road is difficult for fire fighting truck to access, and it is too windy to use air support. Only after a few hours, the fire was blowing so fast and was everywhere, even burned the hospital. However, citizens there did not receive an exact warning of the fire, and their cars stuck on the roads. Even though, the county had a plan to widen to road for evacuation, they did not have enough funds to do so. Paradise burned for over two weeks. Finally, the first winter rains came and put the fire out. It had burned 153,000 acres. Around 30,000 people lost their homes, and many died.
             <br><br>


Climate change has contributed to making fire bigger and more frequent. Ten of the twenty most destructive fires in California have happened in last four years. As far as I am concerned, it is like a vicious circulation. The hotter and the drier the weather is, the more wildfires will be on the Earth. The more wildfires and the more carbon dioxide emission, the hotter and the drier the weather will be. For the wildfire in Paradise, PG&E company should take the majority responsibility. Also, if the county had a wonderful evacuation plan, the situation would be much better. But let’s consider this issue on the other hand. Are we causing the fire in our daily lives? The answer is yes. If we limit emission of carbon dioxide in other ways, the average temperature would not raise so fast that cause wildfires so frequently and unexpectedly.

When the Camp Fire was burning, I didn't realize the magnitude of it, and honestly, I didn't care. Why? Because by that time I had become so accustomed to wildfires, and I was sick of seeing a new one trending on Twitter every other week. And that is not just about wildfires. I had that same "so what?" attitude for everything. Whenever I saw another Tweet about melting glaciers, or sea turtles dying, I would scroll right past, without giving it a second thought. However, the documentary "Fire in Paradise" showed me just how passive and ignorant I had been about these catastrophic events, and how getting all of my news from social media was dehumanizing me, because as a social media user, you always want to see new content, and the "climate change is killing our planet" was becoming a far too repetitive topic.
             <br><br>

The documentary does a great job at appealing to the audience's emotion by showing the perspectives of many different people involved in the fire. People who lost their homes and families, workers whose jobs were affected, and law officials and firefighters. It really adds a human element to the event that you simply cannot imagine by just reading articles, Tweets, or watching the news. After finishing the documentary, I definitely felt guilty for not paying enough attention to the Camp Fire while it was happening. Now, being more educated on the topic, it angers me that so many people suffered because of a lack of attention from the government who did not fund better evacuation routes, and from PG&E who knew it had faulty power lines but ignored the issue. It also showed me that the people in power had the same passive attitude that I had as a social media user because not enough people were angered by the situation. As long as the people being ruled over do not demand rights, the people who rule will never grant them, which is why it is important to take a stand against the big businesses benefiting from the toxic chemicals that are destroying our planet.

I completely understand your situation about being ignorant and apathetic to the Paradise Fire victims because I was in the same shoes as you during that time. I used to feel that the Fire in Paradise headlines were getting repetitive after seeing updates on the event multiple times a day from different news and social media outlets. I remember thinking how this was just another wildfire in California and that the event wasn't worth my time.
             <br><br>


After watching this documentary and taking this course, I deeply regret that I have used to have such an ignorant attitude while thousands lost their homes and communities. The documentary definitely helped me fully understand the scope of this fire's destruction, not only on the city itself, but also on people's lives. I also felt a more emotional connection to those who suffered, whereas before I was disconnected from the victims. I agree that a part of this is because constant media coverage on tragedies will desensitize the public, like I was. I hope that with more documentaries that expose the climate crisis as well as the actions of companies such as PG&E, we can take steps that will help restore the planet.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you. I'm glad that people are more aware of the climate crisis than ever before, but we also must be mindful of how we deal with that. Posting a "thoughts and prayers for Australia, Indonesia, Amazon, California, etc. etc. etc." isn't an effective way to deal with the crisis. Not only does it not do anything, but it desensitizes people to the disasters caused by climate change, which is terrible. If people are apathetic to these crises, then nothing gets done. You're right that we must push this energy to something productive. Instead of tweeting thoughts and prayers, we could tweet to big corporations about the role they're playing in this and try to re-write their reputation as a climate-destroyer. Companies care about their reputation and image. If we use our power as the consumers, we could effect real change. But that is not all. We must also shift politics. As a consumer, it often feels impossible for people to make an impact. It seems that every single company is contributing to destroying the planet and in some cases (like with PG&E) we have no choice but to be their customers. That's why we must make our politicians hold corporations accountable and actually do something. 
             <br><br>

This is why I think that as a film, "Fire in Paradise" did a great job. Films are supposed to make people feel deep emotions and inspire change. I think by focusing on the climate crisis in a more personal and emotional way, the film did its part in inspiring change. It is now up to us to act on these emotions and actually get things done.

During my first year at UCSB I became friends with someone who lived in Paradise. I remember him telling me how beautiful Paradise was and how I had to go visit. But soon his hometown was engulfed in flames and him and his family lost everything. He had to move back in with his family to regroup and restart their lives. I was heartbroken when I heard about the fire, but after watching the documentary “Fire in Paradise” my heart was completely crushed. 
             <br><br>

PG&E was irresponsible for not shutting off the power when they had gotten warnings of high winds. The wind was literally deadly because once the fire started the wind just carried it for miles, burning everything along the way. It looked small but it was hidden at first in a place that firefighters couldn’t get to. This was critical for how the situation played out. Abnormally higher winders and dryer temperatures in November helped fuel the fire even more than usually seen. It was said during the documentary that when fires used to happen back decades ago, they could last a week or so, or longer, but there would be a period after where the firefighters could regroup and get ready to fight the next fire. However, now the fire season is much longer,  the summers are hotter, and we don’t get rain until later in the year, so the conditions are much worse. I really liked when they said a combination of factors with high winds and temperature bone dry is a package of explosives for wildlife; when you throw in a match its a huge catastrophe. 
             <br><br>

It was horrible to see how people’s parents and grandparents stayed in the town because they didn;t see a real threat. Incredibly sad to know that most of them died, especially the grandpa who died in his wheelchair with a hose next to him because he was fighting the fire. I couldn’t help but cry because these people were so misled. I do understand that the authorities did what they could with the chaotic situation, but I do hope that everyone can learn from their mistakes. The authorities did not plan to have all of Paradise evacuate at once so the two lane roads were full of cars bumper to bumper. The town was told years prior that they should make their roads have four lanes total but that would cost $10-$20 million that they didn’t have. Maybe if they had gotten grant money to do so the evacuation would have gone differently. 
             <br><br>

The fires today are different so we must make new plans! We need to prepare for more intense fires. We need to ensure that everyone has evacuation plans and back-up evacuation plans. We need to make fire trucks that are fireproof and teach firemen how to move burning cars on the road! We have to make sure evacuation systems are up to date, working, and constantly tested to ensure everyone’s safety. With our climate getting worse we must adapt or we will suffer the consequences.

The film Fire in Paradise not only talked about the devastating fire that happened in Paradise, but also leaves us pondering what would happen when the real paradise be set on fire on day? For me, I believe Paradise don’t have to be the most gorgeous and prettiest place on Earth, it can be the trail you run every day, or the mountain you camp every weekend. Paradise is where the nature is, which its smoothens our heart and calm our busy souls down. Imagine if we lost that great treasure that we are not even remotely entitled to destroying it. Nature has a special place in my heart. Back in my hometown Atlanta, trees cover every single acre of land. Nature is in our backyard, as it is part of our lives. Standing up top on a local mountain, the whole perimeter Atlanta covered in all kinds of greens is under our gaze. There would be no way I would have imagined my hometown being burned down to ashes. Meanwhile, my family and I had traversed across National parks in Utah and Wyoming last summer,. We had witnessed and captured some breath-taking views. These unearthly views make me once again awe at the magnificence of nature. Now looking back from these memories, it would be quite a pity for these stunning views to be ravaged by fire. 
             <br><br>

On the other hand, as a person who comes from a state where mountain fire is something off the topic, mountain fire still feels like something remote for me --- until we came close to the Cave fire recently, and it was not until then that I realized it is actually quite a big deal over here, and something everyone has to watch out for. It is a thing reading all the black and white numbers and paper reports of fire, but it’s definitely anything for someone to be there and witness it and be terrified by the force of nature. The fire in Paradise is quite a pitiful loss, as there was a lack of preparation and early warning, and I believe it serves as a warning to other counties in California in case if similar instances happening.

The film “Fire in Paradise” frightfully illustrates a present time consequence that we are facing because of anthropocentric climate change. Due to climate change, droughts have become more severe which are perfect conditions for the creation of more dangerous wildfires. Unfortunately, Paradise was directly affected by this in 2018 with the Camp Fire. Having lived in California for many years, I knew of the yearly wildfires that occur but never looked into it. However, I do remember the Camp Fire in particular because of the media coverage that demonstrated its destructive magnitude. Although it was widely covered by the news, I was not completely aware of the events that transpired until I watched this movie. The mixed-use of interviews and live footage effectively portray how the fire started, rapidly spread, and destroyed. Overall, the film shocked me because I did not know how unprepared we are for emergencies such as the fire. Like many of the residents of Paradise, I would also rely on being warned to evacuate and think it is safe to stay if nothing is said. It is staggering that the Camp Fire caused by an old faulty PG&E power line was able to burn a whole town in four hours. Although it was the company’s negligence that created the fire, climate change allowed it to grow and overwhelm us. It goes to show that we are now required to inspect and fully fight disasters that once seemed to pose no threat because although it may seem safe at first, climate change has made disasters more destructive.

For me this is extremely scary, I remember the night that the Cave fire started, I was biking across campus and was physically stopped by the wind. It was that bad. The beginning of the film reminded me of this moment and made me realize how close this problem is to us in Santa Barbara. If this is a yearly or biyearly occurrence, just how long before a fire engulfs our campus. Between the ocean reclaiming DP and the threat of fires every year, it baffles me how people can just claim that this is not a serious problem. Soon there will not be a Santa Barbara for celebrities and the wealthy to live and vacation in. It upsets me that with climate change upon us still, the US cannot institute change. Look at the people in Paradise and tell them there is not climate change and everything they suffered was just a freak accident. 
             <br><br>
Even further, I do not understand how big companies can be repeatedly protected from facing what they have done. PG&E started the Paradise Fire, yet I have the strange feeling in 20 years they will be starting another one. Fossil Fuel companies have ravaged the Earth, contributed to melting the North Pole, and what do they do, buy right to drill in the North. In areas that were once covered by ice. I do not know how humans can do this to other humans.

“Fire in Paradise” was really effective in delivering an accurate and informative depiction of the tragic fire that occurred in Paradise in 2018. It was heart breaking to hear the first hand accounts of victims and citizens in Paradise talking about their traumatic experience of trying to escape the fire and losing people/homes in the process. As Ken says in the introduction video, the documentary “puts a human face on the climate crisis”, helping viewers realize the actual impact on human lives rather beyond just statistics and data. It felt almost unreal to hear the rate at which the fire was spreading – at one point one of the firemen mentions that the fire was spreading at a rate of 7 football fields per minute. 
             <br><br>
Several preventive actions could have been taken to avoid the tragic fire in Paradise. PG&E could have identified and replaced aging powerlines. The city of Paradise could have implemented a more solid alert system. Evacuation plans could have been better designed to account for a potential major fire. Although these issues are significant, and actions should be taken to avoid a situation like this in the future, it is important to keep in mind the overarching impact of climate change on situations like these. Chief David Hawkins does a good job of outlining the effects of climate change on fires – in the mid-1980s, large fires like these still occurred, but they lasted for shorter periods of times. Now, due to hotter, drier, and less humid summer in combination with shorter winter periods, the environment helps fires grow at rates that we have not seen. As a result, even if we plan for circumstances like these, it is difficult because we are trying to prevent situations at scales which we have never seen before.

I completely agree, Fire in Paradise provides an up close and personal account of the terrifying effects of climate change. Ken’s explanation that the documentary “puts a human face on the climate crisis” was something I especially appreciated, because this film explores outside of the normal statistics. While this approach is very niche compared to DiCaprio in Before the Flood, I believe it is just effective in convincing its viewers that the climate crisis is real and here. The facts of the Paradise Fire were mind boggling to hear, from the rate of the fire spreading to the tough communication between emergency dispatchers and average people to the eventual mudslides in Montecito. It clearly conveys how there is more to the climate crisis than just a sea level rise. What disturbed me the most was PG&E’s failure to take ownership of the fire, or at least partake in rebuilding what the fire has stolen from the people of paradise. And while there’s a lot of what-ifs surrounding the Paradise fire, but I think what is the more important issue to focus on is how will other cities respond to this tragic event? Paradise’s intricate evacuation deemed useless compared to the magnitude of the fire, largely due to the fact that an event this large scale wouldn’t be possible if not for climate change. Listening to the accounts of firefighters, police, and other citizens, accurately planning for these horrific situations seems nearly impossible.

I felt the complete same way, I feel like people could have done more to prevent the fire, it felt that everything was just so unorganized. At the same time I can't blame these people for doing their absolute best in evacuating people because I for one have never been put in that type of situation.I'm thinking that perhaps people were more in a state of shock and their response in combatting the fire was delayed for a long period of time. Since the fire did spiral out of control many people were freaking out and had no idea what to expect next. It's hard to put myself in their shoes and what they actually faced, it was more of a life or death situation. Many people can't relate to the dire impacts of climate change because they've never been through it, they've never experienced it first hand.

This film is exactly what more people need to be watching in order to educate themselves on the reality of the climate crisis. As Ken said in the intro video for the film, these fires ARE happening right NOW, and they are a result of climate change. The film is a visual representation of what scientists have been saying is going to happen for YEARS. It scares me that people still even refer to climate change or climate crisis as ‘global warming’, because it is so much more: ocean acidification, global temperature rise, intense hurricanes, fires, floods, etc. I know some of us took this class for a certain requirement or maybe because you’re interested in environmentalism and solving climate change, but we need to spread this information and knowledge that we are all gaining from Climate Crisis 101, exactly like a fire spreads. The more people in the U.S. and other developed countries are educated, the more likely they will want to make changes and help. And this goes for our generation and the older generations, because they still have a significant amount of time to decide to help or make things worse. If we can show films like “Fire in Paradise”, we can emphasize how close to home these affects really are. Similar to the article we read this week, this movie honestly alarmed me and made me realize how the climate crisis is gaining speed as everyday goes by.

I was born in Northern California and have lived there my whole life. The most I thought about climate change was how there was always pollution and how I couldn’t see the stars at night anymore. This all led me to believe that climate change was happening, but not that severe. However, in 2018 there was the Camp Fire, which was very close to where I lived. Me, my family, and my friends were all forced to evacuate and I can still remember the time when my parents woke me up at 2 in the morning and told me to pack all my important stuff because we had to leave. Even though that was just over a year ago, I can still remember the fear in my parents’ faces as they started shoving all their valuables in the suitcase and were running around the house to pack. As we drove out of the city, I could see the smoke overtaking me and we were forced to wear gas masks so ash wouldn’t go into our noses and mouths. When we reached the edge of the city, I looked back and could see the tip of the flame that had destroyed so many houses and taken so many lives.

             <br><br>

This was a catalyst for change in my mind because I had first-hand experience of the disastrous effects of climate change. I used to think that it wasn’t a big deal, but I don’t want anyone to ever have to go through what I went of hearing their parents so scared for their lives and the future. If large corporations keep being ignorant, we all need to gather up and prove that the climate crisis is not only real but also that it’s happening right at this moment.

Before watching the documentary, I always naively ask the question: How do wildfire kill people? I mean, people get notified when disasters happen, when they get notified they use their cars to evacuate, police officers and firefighters also came to help, so how? Well, forgive my ignorance. I never realize how fast a wildfire can spread and how destructive it is until I watched the documentary.
             <br><br>
I was heartbreaking when I saw people not able to escape the fire because they did not get notified in time. And the fact that wildfires kill people make me question myself: am I a murderer, or at least an accomplice? It feels awful to think of the fact that what we do in daily life contributes to climate change, which eventually causes disasters that take peoples lives away. So, are we going to be murderers that carry more peoples’ lives or saviors that together save the earth and ourselves? The decision is in our own hands and it is time for us to be responsible for our daily actions.

The film Fire in Paradise was truly a game changer for me. I have seen many wildfires during my time living on the central coast of California and, if I’m being honest, wildfires are becoming about as common as rain is in my hometown. However, never have I ever seen a wildfire like the one depicted in the film. Not only was the fire massive in size, the speed and aggression with which it spread was mind blowing. Watching the film actually sparked fear within me, a fire of this magnitude is one that you almost can’t escape. I think many other California residents may have had a similar reaction to mine at the time of the Camp Fire because we are all used to seeing wildfires and we know that they are manageable and that firefighters can fight them and even though they suck that’s just a part of living in California, but this fire wasn’t your normal CA fire. This was armageddon. 
             <br><br>

The fact that the most devastating natural disaster of all of 2018 occurred in the 6th wealthiest state of the 11th wealthiest country in the world goes to show that climate change doesn’t care who you are or where you’re from or how much money you have: it takes no prisoners and it is here. I hope as the number of climate caused disasters continues to increase and continues to hit places previously thought to be untouchable, that more people not only accept that we are in the midst of a worldwide crisis but actually change their ways in order to try to save our planet. The climate crisis does not discriminate and because of the actions of a few wealthy, consumption driven people the entire world will suffer.

Watching the Documentary, “Fire in Paradise” was interesting and well recorded. I liked how they had live footage of the fire by people in danger. Even though that the fire wasn’t started naturally and could be blamed on PG&E for not fixing their equipment on time, we are the ones to be blamed for creating the perfect conditions for the Fires in Paradise to spread the way that they did. They were spreading at an astonishing rate covering the morning skies making the town look like it was in a movie. Their day turned into a night or at least it seemed like it was due to how thick the smoke was.
             <br><br>
 The Thomas Fire was one of the first fires that woke me up from how we set up the world to create terrifying events in our lifetime. I just remember my cousin sent me a video of her wiping the ground with her shoe and under all the ash she moved was her floor mat. Her floor mat to the front door of her house was completely covered in ash. I live in Anaheim   and I like about an hour and 30 minutes from where the Thomas fire took place and I was still able to see ash landing on the cars in my hometown. That is crazy to think that these ashes traveled that far. This fire was, “like nothing recorded in California,” which was scary to many Californians. To hear that the Ranch Fire, which occurred half a year later and burned ½ a million acres is terrifying. Then having The Campfire fire in the same year as the previous two was making people go insane. It was the “most destructive natural disaster worldwide in 2018, and deadliest wildfire in California History” as said by professor Ken.

The most astonishing part in the film “Fire in Paradise” I find is how catastrophic the fire was while people neglected it when it first ignited. The company PG&E was found responsible for this fire because the electric tower served longer than its life expectancy, and the parts fall off. I was impressed with how vulnerable people can be when the fire came even though so many evacuation plans were prepared. I heard about how devastating fire can be, but I’ve never seen such horrible scenes like those in the movies. There was one scene in which the residences in Paradise were evacuating. The road was totally engulfed by the fire, and sparks flying over the road as if it was a stream flowing across it. This movie is very emotionally appealing especially when the survivors who lost their family members were interviewed. I feel like though they get over with the terrible feeling of being trapped in the fire, it’s still hard for them to totally forget the pain of losing people they love.
             <br><br>

This fire was unexpectedly destructive partially because of the weather conditions which helped the fire to expand eastward, and the strong wind made air rescue nearly impossible. I think we should all raise awareness because many natural disasters can’t be foresighted, or their destructiveness can not be precisely predicted. The rise in temperature causes longer summertime, more drought, and increased possibility of larger mountain fires in summer.

Growing up, I would spend almost every Thanksgiving and Christmas at my Grandma’s house in Paradise. It was a place that always felt safe, just a small sleepy retirement community on a mountain.  About two years ago, my Dad had moved in with my Grandma to take care of her as she was going through her cancer treatment. They did not know there was a fire until my Uncle called them (who did not live in Paradise but had seen reports on the news) and asked if they had evacuated. Then they saw flames in the backyard and immediately left, they didn’t even have time to find my Grandma’s cat (the cat survived though). This documentary made me remember how lucky I am that both my Dad and my Grandma made it out of that fire, and how much others lost.

In October of 2017, I returned home early from a concert at a local winery because I had school in the morning. Around 1 in the morning my mother came into my room and woke me up and opened my window blinds. From my second-story window I could see the hill about 2 miles away from house was overcome by an orange glow. I would not be returning to school for two weeks. I have grown up in Napa basically my entire life; our community has endured a devastating earthquake and several fires. The house that we spent Passover at is now ashes, my favorite view spot is charred and where a house used to sit, and we are all emotionally affected by these events. 
             <br><br>
One part of the documentary resonated with me when a fire marshal was talking about how none of the circumstances of the fire were unprecedented. No one thinks that a major natural disaster is going to affect them. When we evacuated out of Napa, we fortunately went to our house in Tahoe and hiked in the fresh air. We weren't exactly sure if the fire was going to take our house in Napa, and I can empathize with the residents of Paradise because I know that frustration, the confusion, the worry. 
             <br><br>
Who do we blame? Is PG&E to blame? I can definitely agree that they have been negligent. But climate change is also the cause of the fires, and WE have caused that. 
             <br><br>
During the fires in Napa, I volunteered at a refuge sorting donations. I talked to the families that were displaced. Everyone was nice and in kind spirits. No one was outwardly outraged. I am outraged, we all should be. I am upset that whenever we see a fire warning in my hometown that we joke "Napa's on fire again lol". Why is this a norm? Burning to death should be and IS terrifying and gruesome. Not knowing if your house or family or community is going to be okay is scary. This documentary hurt my stomach and I had to stop myself from the mental images; I can't help but empathize. 
             <br><br>
I want to prevent major natural disasters from becoming a norm. But I need to know how to do that...

After watching “Fire in paradise”, it made me feel somewhat frustrated and heartbroken about the disastrous wildfires in California and how negligence from the power company brought more pain. At the start of the film,  it was interesting to see how the power company decided not to turn off its power to increase profits, and excused it on the winds dying down. It is absolutely devastating to see the amount of damage these fires did, and how intense they were.
             <br><br>


Growing up in California my whole life, I have seen firsthand the absolute destruction and pain these intense fires have caused. I remember as a kid having to smell constant amounts of smoke in a wildfire near my house, as me and my parents ran out of our house not knowing if our possessions were safe or not. It was the scariest time of my life, not knowing if when I came back if I would have a house or not. 
             <br><br>


The idea that these large mega-companies profit off of the environment and make disastrous events like Paradise so much worse, is also something that I have seen firsthand. When I was back home, I would always remember smelling some form of rotten eggs in the air. Later on, people had become more aware of the smell and were concerned. As I lived near an oil company, they constantly kept drilling oil from the earth even though there was a leak in its system. This caused people to become sick, and ultimately protest against the company. It took months of protesting for the oil company to finally stop drilling, but still had such a negative impact on the air quality around our community. This goes to show that companies such as the one in the movie need to be quality checked and have more restrictions.

When watching the film for this week "Fire in  Paradise" I really felt the effects of what a fire can do to a whole community. I think humans are typically used to the idea that a fire starts and it will be put out before it has the ability to burn a whole town. But in this case, it was just not possible due to the weather and lack of rain. Everything was dry and the wind was strong making the fire move fast and jump starting spot fires everywhere. As I listened to the stories of the individual people, it horrified me. I can't imagine what it must have felt like to not know if you would make it out or where your family was. The story of the women that had to get out of her car and run, hit me hard. She didn't know if she would find another car to make it out, all she could do was run. It was also hard to watch and listen to the stories the 911 dispatchers had. Everything was moving too fast and they just couldn't get everyone the help they needed in time. It is just crazy to think about the damage this one place saw in such a short amount of time. It is even crazier and sacrier to think that fires like these have become something of a normalcy to prepare for in California and on an even scarier note, if we don't address climate change they will only get larger and more common.

This film was the scariest movie I have ever watched. Sure, I'm not a fan of horror movies, but still. I live in NorCal, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and every shot of the scenery, the views, the people, and even the wooden bear statue just looked so much like home. The shots of the fire spreading looked like they could have been in my or my neighbor's backyard. I know forest fires are an issue, I've grown up with that threat. I guess I just never realized how much anxiety I harbor about them until now. The film talked about how people felt safe in Paradise, and now I don't feel as safe at home. Look, I've been evacuated because of a fire before, but it was small, and I was safe. I've also been trapped at my house before because all of the two roads that go to it were blocked off. I don't know what I would do if both were to occur at once.

             <br><br>

All of the movies I've watched for your English 22 class felt very wide. They focused on a multitude of issues and only gave small moments to individuals affected by the climate crisis. This film spent a long time on people, and the family they lost, or the fear they felt. That was an immensely difficult thing to watch. It's one thing to grieve for a population. It's another thing to grieve for a mother. 
             <br><br>


I am so furious at PGE. They are a monopoly. They are incompetent. They have killed. I don't care if a company can not go to jail, jail its CEO, its stockholders. Fines do nothing to stop crime. They are just how much it costs to break the law. Someone needs to pay, otherwise, we're teaching the lesson that big businesses can get away with murder.

             <br><br>

If I'm being honest, watching Fire in Paradise, or even writing this comment was taxing. I was planning on replying to comments this week, but this was something I had to speak about on my own terms.

Wow honestly seeing this documentary left me very impacted. It left me very concerned as this incident occurred very close to where we currently reside. It is just an example of how climate change is affecting us whether we like it or not. Recent fires in memory are meant to show us that we need to act now and not continue to delay the consequences of the climate crisis. “Climate change has contributed to making fires bigger and more frequent. Ten of the 20 most destructive fires in California have happened in the last four years.” Those numbers are something to be worried about. Our state is one of the ones feeling the effects of climate change more severely than others and this brush fire is an example of that. A small and simple fire turned out severe because of climate change. It created poor weather conditions which made it impossible for firefighters to put it out, and caused it to spread at an incredible rate. It spread very quickly and resulted in the deaths and loss of homes of many. It burnt down hospitals, homes, and entire communities. What else needs to happen to create a change? More deaths, more loss of homes? The time to act is now as our generation is in grave danger in the near future. Fires like this are the beginning of more natural disasters caused by climate change and we need to find ways to slow this process down. It is honestly scary how much of these incidents are occurring in the state I reside in. Our state is going to experience more disasters if nothing is done to solve the climate crisis. Living through those events must be fearful, as people not just lose their minds, but they also forget how to act. 
             <br><br>

This fire shows us that we must be prepared for more of these events. We need to have a cohesive plan just in case we’re affected by an event of this gratitude. It is also very important to stay informed within our communities, form connections, and most importantly work together. In this incident one of the biggest issues was communication. Many died due to a lack of alerting within the community, because it honestly came as an unexpected surprise. It just shows that we need to act fast when there’s no other option; it’s either life or death. I feel that we need to better prepare for events such as a simple fire, as when it gets out of control we are in grave danger if we aren’t alerted in time. We are prone to facing incidents like this because of the state we live in and because of recent memory. Climate change is a reality now and we must accept it, but most importantly work to fix it.

First off, learning that the area covered by the Australian brush fires was more than 4 times as big as the 15 largest fires in recorded California history combined is absolutely devastating, nerve-racking, and almost unbearable. On the other hand, “Fire in Paradise” should be regarded as a very effective documentary in which the audience can allude to various implications regarding the climate crisis (especially involving local dangers). Although the Frontline film does not focus much on any dialogue or discussion surrounding the current climate crisis, it documents many emotional accounts of the most deadly, devastating, and expensive wildfire in California’s history; a history that has been marked by continuous and vast wildfires in recent decades. While watching this film, I couldn’t stop thinking about the danger members of my family faced during the 2007 Witch and Harris Fires in San Diego. The blaze came within a few miles of my cousins’ house, where I spent much of my childhood growing up in and having the best memories at. “Fire in Paradise” gave an emotional insight to how devastating it would’ve been for my family if the fire wasn’t averted out of the path of their neighborhood. It is also very astonishing how the chain of events involving the California firefighters, emergency services, and first responders played out; how the firefighters couldn’t even get a clear understanding of how fast the fire was burning and spreading because they were occupied with evacuations and saving lives right from the get-go. I have so much gratitude for all of the firefighters who have put their lives on the line to save so many others, they deserve an endless amount of respect.

A recurring theme that I’ve noticed in many of the environmental films/articles shared in our class thus far is that, some effects of climate change (more intense wildfires, etc.) have, oftentimes, direct cause and effect relationships with companies like PG&E. In this specific film, PG&E directly caused the wildfire due to, as they stated in the film, a piece of equipment that failed. In other instances, many energy companies have polluted the earth, therefore causing many of the climate change phenomena that we see today. At one point, these effects of climate change were miniscule, but now, what could’ve once been an easily stoppable fire has instead ravaged paradise. And the funny thing is, because these companies correlate so closely with the effects of climate change, it should be obvious that we should target these monstrous companies because they will never stop cutting corners environmentally to make more money.
             <br><br>

This film was especially horrifying and saddening to me because the paradise fire could've been completely avoided (since it was originally a manageable fire). But, because the road that it was closest to was a small dirt road that wouldn’t be able to support a fire truck and air support wasn’t possible since it was too windy in that region, the fire spread quickly. In his report, the police officer notes that the fire was manageable, but he couldn’t get to it, which must’ve been a very hard thing to have to bear, knowing that all of the damage caused by the paradise fire could've been avoided, if only you had had the access.
             <br><br>

Of all of the personal accounts of the people impacted by the fires, it was especially sad to hear the story of the man in the wheelchair who was putting out fires in his beloved farm with his hose. It was also really difficult to watch how all of the patients and staff in the hospital just had to be stuffed into random cars (they were carrying their own ivs, they were coming right out of surgery, etc). Although sick people need special care, this fire was such a threat that the staff literally had to randomly put as many people in cars as possible.
             <br><br>
It was extremely depressing to see the destruction of Paradise right in front of my eyes and the fact that about 30,000 people lost their houses is just devastating.

I have been avoiding this film because it hits close to home, literally. I am from a town next to paradise and many of my friends and classmates were from paradise. It’s as if not watching the film would make the Camp Fire not exist.  Not watching it allowed me to shield myself to the destruction that affected my hometown and my loved ones. Paradise was a magical looking town, and it was left stark, black, and gray. The evergreen pine trees that fluffed along the streets turned into black sinister looking toothpicks.  Seeing the personal videos, the houses on fire, the restaurants I would go to with my friends up in flames is surreal, painfully devastating, made me feel impotent, just as how I felt when I first heard about it by my friends back in my hometown. Panic, I felt panicked and powerless when I talked to my friends and family over the phone the morning of the fire. Though I knew of the risks of wildfires, I truly never believed something like this would ever happen, especially this close to home. As shown in class by the iclicker polls, we are all worried, but not worried enough. 
             <br><br>

When I heard one of the interviewees say “We didn’t have a plan to evacuate the entire town because it wouldn’t work” it made me mad. This, mass destruction, is what climate change is causing. At this point, we gotta prepare for the worst because the worst is happening right now. Things that were not common are becoming common, and we’re getting used to it without realizing the dangerous situation we are all in. People don’t realize the severity of the situation, we are in denial mode up until the moment we are about to die. This mentality was seen by those who, like the older mother in the documentary, did not evacuate when there was clear danger. This mentality also applies to us as human beings who inhabit the planet, we are in denial mode about climate change up until the moment when we are up in flames.

After watching the documentary "Fire in Paradise", I am reminded of a Facebook post from a friend of mine. She grew up in Paradise, and though I always imagined a quiet, peaceful town from her descriptions, that post really struck me with a heartbreaking image. Her house was burnt down by the raging fires, and she really felt devastated and hopeless at the time of the disaster. Although I did not come from a place that's likely threatened by fires, I reached out and pitched in a small donation to help her overcome the situation, however insignificant that might be. 
             <br><br>

It is important to feel optimistic and contribute positively to the solution, but I cannot help but feel sad and angered by the current administration's reaction to this crisis. Not only did they not implement measures to prevent future fires, they actually rolled back a lot of the protective legislature that's designed to thwart corporate mismanagement. I really wish that the people who call climate change a hoax and a political stunt can change their minds...maybe they are the ones who deserve to pay for these consequences, instead of the innocent civilians whose lives were put to risk for the crimes they've committed.

In response to the rude, incompetent cop-comparing the 85 deaths to the 50,000 people that escaped sounds like a successful evacuation if we were only looking at numbers. Just imagine if evacuations were sent out the second smoke was spotted. 85 lives could have been spared and saved from their homes had there been any sense of communication. I think if this had been the case, then, and only then, could this evacuation been labeled as a success.
             <br><br>


This film immediately made me wonder where I was during the time of the Paradise Fire. I remember waking up to Snapchat news stories of people being trapped in cars on burning highways. I could not believe it was in California. Screaming videos recording people who were certain they were going to die was not something the world expected to open their phones to. Now all I can think about it the intensity of documentaries that will be made about the Australian wildfires. These were started by lightning strikes, mostly on drought-ridden land that engulfed the entire continent.  Still, the damage is absolutely insane and far worse.

Being an out of state student, I had not known much about the Camp fire except for the occasional snippets I would see on live television. It wasn't until I watched the documentary that I gained a true grasp on how absolutely devastating the whole situation was. Seeing how within a matter of 3 hours, an entire town of nearly 27,000 people can be scorched to the ground was astonishing. The scene that chilled me the most was when police officers were desperately trying to evacuate patients from the hospital as the flames quickly surrounded them. Even though the documentary mentioned that Paradise emergency services had trained for this type of scenario (especially when compared to other surrounding communities), it still was not enough to prepare them for this hellish nightmare. It was also crazy to think that with the right conditions (dry environment, extreme winds, long dry spell), a small little spark from a power line could become the largest fire in California history. I feel that this film is important in spreading awareness about the immediate effects of climate change and how it doesn't only effect the poor rural countries, but also those who are affluent as well. It is evident that climate change doesn't discriminate based on wealth.

This film changed my perception of wildfires. I, like many people, had a perception of fire as something that could be controlled. Many people view wildfires this way since they have been  generally controllable in the past, much more than they are now, exhibited by how many out of control fires we have experienced in the past few years. My perspective changed because this movie showed a completely uncontrollable fire. I did not grow up in California but many of the people I have talked to who did understand this nature of today's wildfires very differently because they have dealt personally with them. People are more tuned into the changing climate when they experience it personally. I found this to be an incredible powerful documentary because it made me understand the experiences of people met with the effects of climate change. This seems to be an essential component for making people care who are otherwise not yet having to face the effects. The other thing this movie depicts is how outpaced our plans are by the changing climate. Someone in the movie refers to it as "one of the first real climate adaptation problems." I found this to be an incredibly powerful documentary. Many people express being numb to numbers and statistics. This certainly is part of the apathy towards climate change, but a film like this that shows personal stories is very powerful for making people care.

I could not believe it when you said the Paradise fire was the “most destructive natural disaster worldwide” in 2018! It makes me wonder how there can still be climate change deniers. I feel disappointed that people don’t care more. The consequences are here. 
             <br><br>
Also, the film doesn’t offer solutions. I think that this is what makes this film different, and very moving. Its focus is on the destruction, and how it was nearly impossible to stop from spiraling out of control. 
             <br><br>

As you have brought up, to some it may seem like climate change is far away. These people might think of the ocean rising in poorer island countries when they think of climate change. What they don’t consider is the fact that mansions in California are at risk too, because the ocean and climate do not discriminate. It will “impact all sorts of people in all kinds of ways.” This makes me feel anger toward the people who knowingly deny climate change for more money, such as politicians, because people are getting hurt. Even though it is true that people in the Maldives may lose their homes to the ocean before people in California, it can be seen that even people in wealthy Montecito are not safe from the destruction. 
             <br><br>

I believe this film takes an unorthodox viewpoint on how to get people to care about climate change, and I believe it was successful. I believe that the way to get people to care is through teaching about actual events, because speculation about the future doesn’t always work on people.

Wildfires like the Campfire have become disgustingly normalized. I remember when it happened. Of course I felt sympathy for how many people lost their homes and family members, but I didn’t find that it was particularly shocking to me anymore. It seems like each year we see on the news “most destructive California wildfire in history”, and I wonder, how many more people have to die until we change our carbon obsessed lifestyles? How many homes, businesses, schools, churches, etc. have to burn before we take serious change? Climate change only makes wildfire season longer, which means that not only will there be more wildfires, but they will be of a greater magnitude. This same trend applies to tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts -- they will only increase in both frequency and magnitude. 
             <br><br>


I remember in 2017 when the Thomas fire broke out, finals were cancelled, and even though the fire was close to my home and extremely destructive I still did not feel like it posed a huge threat to my life because of how normal these occurrences have become. I truly did not understand the severity of the Campfire until watching the film. The movie did an excellent job in putting a human face on the climate crisis. I felt most touched by the nurse who was evacuating patients from the hospital, and was then stuck in traffic and had to run through fire just to survive. I kept envisioning something like that happening to my small hometown, with everybody waking up to their homes, work, and normal life, but going to sleep with your home and work burned to the ground, praying that you didn’t lose any family members or loved ones. The tragic loss of life was a combination of multiple factors -- the faulty escape routes, the inability to evacuate everyone, and the old PG&E towers, but climate change undoubtedly played a huge role in the deaths of the 85 victims. To deny climate change after a tragedy like this is completely insensitive to the thousands of people who lost their homes, jobs and family members to the Campfire. I hope that this was the last tragedy that occurs as a result of California wildfires, but in our current environmental state, I sadly think that it is inevitable, and that we will only see wildfires with more detrimental consequences. 

             <br><br>

I think this serves as a huge reminder that none of us are immune to the effects of climate change. Yes, we are definitely more advanced than most other parts of the world, and are able to rebuild after a tragedy like this happens, but we are wildly ill-equipped to deal with catastrophes of such a large proportion.

As someone who has lived in California their whole entire life, it was extremely scary and sad to watch “Fire in Paradise”. Wildfires are nothing new to me but seeing the true destruction of them at that size was saddening. It was worrisome to me that the whole entire cities and communities could be wiped out in a matter of hours, and not stand a chance. I remember when I was 15 and there was a really bad fire in my canyon by my house that rained ash all over my neighborhood. People had masks on and were extremely scared and just waiting to be evacuated. I could only imagine how those in “Fire in Paradise” felt getting the evacuation calls. Not to mention I got chills when I heard the dispatch calls in the documentary. This film made me realize that even though that fire was far from home, it still hit me close to home and personally. It’s disturbing to me that so many people though will blame these destructive fires on man and the lack of forest control. This is just flat out ridiculous considering that we’ve been in a drought for quite some time. People need to stop choosing politics over the earth.

Living in Southern California for the majority of my life, wildfires have always been a common occurrence, and have become an expected part of living in the area. I remember hearing about friends in my area having to evacuate due to fires throughout my life and fearing what would happen if my own neighborhood was devastated by wildfire. Watching this film, I really got to see what it is like to see your own town destroyed by a natural disaster, which is greatly influenced by climate change and human involvement in the increasing levels of carbon in the atmosphere. It is heartbreaking to see Paradise faced with such devastation, and scary to think about the fact that the same thing can happen in towns all over Southern California. In fact, as we continue to destroy our planet, the likelihood of this happening is only increasing. 
             <br><br>

This documentary was incredibly effective in putting an emotional connection into the issue of climate change. Watching the film, it is difficult not to put myself in the position of those attempting to flee the fires and facing the reality that their home has been destroyed. Although this was a huge tragedy that should not have happened, I hope that climate change deniers put themselves in the place of those living in Paradise and realize that we can not live in ignorance any longer. Climate change is no longer an issue that we can watch from afar and plan on preventing later on in the future. Climate change and its effects are unfolding in front of us now, and are only going to worsen if we do not change our path and make major changes. Otherwise, I fear to see what will occur and how much destruction must happen in order for a real difference to be made.

It is scary to think about how something like this could also happen in our hometowns. This film added a very human touch to the issue of climate change. Visibly seeing fire and destruction paints in our minds a future that is bleak if we do not act. I, too, had some friends that were getting evacuated. It was a very scary time for them since they had to leave on such short notice. 
             <br><br>


I also agree whole heartedly to your statement about climate change deniers. In the case of wildfires and their increasing frequency, it is irrefutable evidence that something bad is happening. I recall in lecture when someone went on the mic and spoke about how some people that were climate change deniers changed their minds completely after they were directly affected by the Paradise fire.

The documentary “Fire in paradise,” was a heartbreaking, yet eye opening film that made it clear that the United States will not be exempt from the consequences of climate change. Sometimes we feel like we are so far away (time and location wise)  from actually feeling the effects of climate change, but its time to change that mindset. It sad that it took a tragedy like this to open peoples eyes to the climate crisis but we should have seen it coming. It angered me that the town, and many other towns alike, are not willing to build new roads or make the most efficient plans for these disasters, especially when they are becoming more and more prevalent. Even as individuals, many of us haven’t been taking climate change seriously.  We’ve heard the warnings for decades, seen the consequences all around the world, read the articles, but now its us being affected by it. I just hope that it doesn’t take another tragedy, like losing our homes or a loved one, for us to mobilize and finally start taking action against climate change. 
             <br><br>
	There isn’t much understanding that these fires are changing because of climate change. They are growing in size and in prevalence. I was angered by PG&E’s reckless decisions which ultimately started the fire. I don’t understand how companies can only think about making a profit in the moment and not think about the community and the people around them. Even if they only cared about making profit, one or two days of loss of profit should be worth being able to supply the town with electricity for decades in a safe manner and also avoiding potential lawsuits. 
             <br><br>
	California, even the U.S.A as a whole, is not adapting to climate change quick enough and that terrifies me. Although our county has always been a top world leader, we are not stepping up when its needed the most. I don’t know how many more lives need to be lost or how much more damage has to be done before we finally realize that our “paradise” is coming to an end if we don’t start taking climate change seriously.

"Fire in Paradise" provided an emotional and worrisome look at the issue of wildfires in California. We are given the heartbreaking perspectives of those affected by the fire, something I never really looked into or stopped to think about. Along with the forests, people's livelihoods and families suffered immensely. I was really taken aback by the death count of 85 people, with the majority of them being over the age of 65. An especially terrifying aspect of the fire was how it basically trapped residents. I can't imagine being stuck in traffic in the middle of pure chaos and destruction. In addition, first responders and 911 operators could not save everyone who relied on them to make them feel safe or secure. Despite every effort to be prepared for a wildfire, it did little to stop the raging flames that engulfed people's homes and livelihoods. 
             <br><br>

This tragedy paints a picture of the unstoppable nature of an angry Mother Earth. It illustrates just a taste of the destruction that awaits humanity if we continue on a path of neglecting the environment. Furthermore, it seemed to everyone in the fire that there was little hope of escape. This same feeling of hopelessness has already seeped into myself and those concerned about the climate crisis. This film depicted the ruthlessness of climate change and how even attempts to be prepared for it are futile.

There are so many consequences as a result of climate crisis as this class and its material has already exposed us too. This documentary “Fire in Paradise” only looks out of one condition from climate change, wildfires. Specifically, as Professor Hiltner says, wildfires caused by drought conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis. Moreover, this film only goes over one fire and it’s one of absolute destruction and devastation. There are so many tragedies that have happened in California and in the world that I eventually lose track and it was really disheartening to watch this documentary and to think this catastrophic fire happened just over a year ago. It was so sad to hear of the stories, though it was very necessary -- it gave face to the disaster. 
             <br><br>

It is so disgusting to remember that PG&E’s gross negligence led to this fire reaching Paradise and burning it entirely. Learning that a piece of equipment failing led to all of this. We could live without service and WIFI for hours to days. It would have been a much, much outcome to take that precaution. I found myself choked up several times watching this. For the woman who called her husband, crying that she won’t be able to make it and the husband desperately telling her she’ll have to run through fire… The hospital patients, from those right out of surgery to those holding their own IV bags, being rushed out doctors and nurses using their own personal vehicles to only remain stuck… The three women who called for help because that’s all they could do who died while on the phone because there was no help. All of this was so heartbreaking.
             <br><br>

15 out of 20 Californian wildfires have occurred in the 21st century and to think, the fire in Australia is FOUR times as large as all 15 wildfires of California combined. PG&E’s gross negligence should not be forgotten nor simply forgiven. That behavior should not be tolerated. And further neglect and disregard should not be tolerated today and that goes out to disasters today, like the Australia wildfire, and for the future. PG&E made their choice and we also have a choice when it comes to what we can do: mitigate the effects of climate crisis. We can make the choice to do better from not deliberately start ridiculous bushfires to simply caring for our environment in several other conscious ways. The Camp Fire came from a decision not made. Future consequences of the climate crisis can come from decisions we didn’t make in the past and continue to fail to make today and tomorrow and if that’s what we dare to follow, we are following PG&E’s cruel example.

The Frontline documentary, “Fire in Paradise” angered and saddened in more ways than one. From the negligence of PG&E, the incompetence of the officials, and the unpreceded trauma of the Paradise citizens that could have been spared, every minute of this horrendous story pained me to watch and frankly made me even more angrier at the society we live in today. More importantly, the girl who left her mom is what really drew the line for me. Of course, it is incredibly hard to make a life-changing decision when everything around you is engulfed in flames, but who in their right mind would leave their mother there to die because ‘you had your own life to live?’ I get that some people may support her decision, and I understand that her mother did not want to leave, but everything she said made me not feel sorry for her even more as her storyline progressed. Her mother was probably a climate change denier, but no matter how much she refused, she knew what was going to happen if she left her there– and it did. Personally, I would have dragged and pushed my mom out of the house and I wouldn’t care how much she refuses. Even if I was stuck in a public area with a stranger I have never seen in my life, I would never leave anyone there to die. I wasn’t raised like that and would not want someone’s life on my conscious. I don’t know if it was just me, but her storyline really made me angry and uneasy and I felt as if she had no remorse for her actions. On the other hand, the girl who lost her grandfather absolutely broke my heart. Most of the people who lost their lives in the fire were over the age of 65, and when she started talking about her story, I could not stop myself from tearing up. Coming back to your home looking like a warzone is one thing, but knowing your grandfather didn’t survive and seeing his wheelchair next to a burnt water hose and bucket is a picture I would never want anyone to see. Up until his last moments, he was trying to save himself, his environment, and everyone around him knowing it wouldn’t make a difference. I was just in complete shock after watching this documentary. From the firefighter who was driving a bulldozer in the middle of the fire to push engulfed cars out of the way, to the nurse who was forced to run for her life, and the incredibly heartbreaking phone calls from the victims, I had no words. All I knew was that I was angry.
             <br><br>
This is the reality of climate change; although the fire was not climate change’s doing, its trail progressed into something so detrimental that you could literally see it from space. Our negligence to ruining our country is SO annoying and it pisses me off to see that a multi-billion dollar company will not spend a penny on its customers until they see a real threat. Even when the threat was seen, nothing was done! Corporations are so money hungry that the safety of our people and the future of our planet literally means nothing to them as long as their bank account is capitalized. Even moreso, the government’s incompetence for not widening the roads (for a trauma they foresaw) because it would cost them a percent of the money they have was upsetting and made me even more angrier. The trauma in Paradise could have been prevented, but no one took the action or spent the money to do so. This entire ordeal could have been avoided if we were all held accountable for our actions. If these large corporations do not see that they’re ruining our lives by the second, we will be left with nothing sooner than we think.

Overall, the film did a fantastic job depicting the utter destructiveness that the Camp Fire caused and the emotional effects it had on the people of Paradise.  Definitely some of the most moving parts of the film were hearing the first account stories from the people involved in the fires.  It was devastating, yet moving, to hear people from all backgrounds tell their side of the story and what they were doing in the moments of the fire.  Hearing about the struggles that people went through while trying to evacuate truly terrified me as it really put into perspective the utter helplessness some people felt while trying to escape.  Prior to watching this film, I was unaware of how destructive this fire was and just how threatening companies like PG&E are to the climate crisis.  I knew fires were something that ravaged California almost on a yearly basis, but I never really acknowledged the causes of these fires and how horridly they devastate people’s lives.  The film definitely helped me to realize that the climate crisis, although a global issue, is right here in my home state. 

             <br><br>

A part of the film that really summed up the devastation caused by the Camp Fire and that truly stuck out to me was when District Attorney Mike Ramsey dubbed the fire as “our local 9/11.”  It is crazy to think that an incredibly destructive natural disaster could have such a profound effect on people that it is compared to one of the worst days in American history.  It was also unsettling to hear of the massive destruction that PG&E has caused to not only Paradise but other parts of the country as well.  Russell Gold, senior reporter for “The Wall Street Journal,” sums up PG&E 
             <br><br>
pretty well by saying that if it were a person, there is no doubt it would be in prison by now.  It is scary to think that a large corporation, not even a person, can devastate so many lives in such a short amount of time.

"Fire in Paradise" was a heartbreaking film to watch as we witnessed countless people lose their homes to an unstoppable force.  So many people who had worked so hard to establish their lives had everything thrown away due to a seemingly random change in luck due to the cumulative effects of carbon pollution from all around the world.  Even if these individuals had a very small carbon footprint, they would have still felt the consequences of others who carelessly pump carbon into the atmosphere, and they could then complain about the climate injustice, similar to how the many people in third world countries will feel the full force of climate change even though they contributed the least to the disaster.  

             <br><br>

The film demonstrated that not only are the facts of climate change undeniable, but the fact that we are forced to deal with it is now undeniable as well.  We are no longer preventing something, we now have to react.  We have entered the stage in the climate crisis where we are just going to have to deal with what we have created.  U.S. politics should be focusing on conservative and liberal ideas on how to deal with these natural disasters, but it has become so polarized that our politics are still stuck on trying to convince much of the community that these even are effects of climate change.  Therefore, we are going to have to find new areas and ways to create a community that will mitigate the damage of climate change because we are currently and unsuccessfully trying to use old, outdated forms of debate and technology to fix a new, unprecedented problem.  The climate crisis now spans outside of just science, and into politics, economics, society, and culture as it becomes very probable that climate change will have a large influence on every aspect of our lives.

I agree with your comment that we are no longer preventing something, but are having to reduce the impact of the ongoing effects. The deadly force of the California wildfires  should not be taken lightly and companies like PG&E and politicians like Trump should not be brushing this off as an accident due to mismanagement. The deaths in the Camp Fire and Thomas Fire proves that regardless of your class and political views the effects of climate change can be lethal. Now of all times it is very crucial that we see eye to eye with each other and identify that climate change is a common enemy, and the old ways of debating on a topic will not suffice with this time sensitive issue.

Watching "Fire in Paradise" was like watching a horror movie. To the people of Paradise, it almost definitely was like being in a horror movie. This documentary had me in utter shock. What I did like about it was the way they portrayed what went down, in terms of telling the story chronologically (with the added time stamps of the major shift in events during the fire) as well as being as straightforward as possible with the information they give. Highlighting personal experiences also gave an emotional touch to the documentary. It wasn't just a documentary stating facts about the fire, but it gives the victims a spotlight to talk about their experiences--what went wrong and why things went wrong. You really get a glimpse of laziness or idleness in companies/authority figures. 
             <br><br>


One of the most salient scenes in Fire in Paradise was when the 911 operator said he had to just get as much information and keep the the women on the line who was trapped inside their burning house along with two other women. I believe he said that the line was suddenly cut off and all he could do was pick up the next phone call. It was absolutely heartbreaking. You could see how helpless the operator felt, and sometimes that's how I feel in regards to the climate crisis. You can do as much as you can to help which is a great thing, but sometimes it's just not enough. I could go vegan and take public transportation or have an electric car and sign petitions to revoke fracking, but it just doesn't feel like enough. The 911 operator was doing his job and tried to help, but in the end, with all the roads were on fire in addition to the heavy traffic, he couldn't grab them and pull them out of the house himself. Similarly, it feels like (at least to me) all these small environmentally friendly changes I make in my life don't seem enough because I don't see the changes right away. Reversing the effects of climate change will be a slow and gradual process and not seeing immediate change can seem discouraging.

This film was particularly difficult for me to watch. In June of 2016 my childhood home burned to the ground. I shared very similar feelings of frustration to a lot of the people interviewed in this clip. On one of the worst mornings of my life my mother and I saw a small amount of smoke over the hills beyond our backyard. My mother, being the paranoid woman she is, called the fire department immediately. We were told our house was in no danger and there was no need to evacuate. Within a mere two hours, we had less than 30 minutes to get out of our house before it was engulfed in flames. I used to be so angry at the management of the fire department, questioning how they could tell us we weren’t in danger and had no need to worry and a few hours later the home I grew up in was a pile of ashes. This film put in perspective how difficult large fires are to actually maintain and how if the wind is not in your favor, most hope is lost. 
             <br><br>
Fires are the norm in my hometown during the summer months. Sadly, the center of Washington state is not the only place where fires due to droughts are extremely common. This film accurately displayed the whirlwind of emotions that occur and how devastating fires can be.

Growing up in California, fires have always been apart of my family as my dad was a firefighter for 30 years. Hearing his stories firsthand really opened my eyes up to how much destruction comes with these incidents, and also how preventable fires can be. The camp fire could have been prevented had the electric company made efforts to check their power lines and to make sure nothing was broken or old which would have saved many lives. While accidents still happen and you cannot completely take away the risk, prevention is the best way to fight fires. This documentary really showed what happens when people are careless and fail to prepare for a potential natural disaster. While climate change does not do anything to help the situations with fires, I personally don't think it is to blame completely. Instead it is the incompetence of people that often leads to these fires as they don't understand often what the fallout could be from certain decisions. While yes sometimes fires are caused by nature such as a lightning strike, they are more of a result of manmade decisions. I could not believe that the electric company was not being held liable for their mismanagement of their power lines. I understand that turning power off helps prevent fires from happening, but instead why not go into those areas and find ways to fix the existing power lines to prevent fires instead of leaving towns without power for days.

“Fire in Paradise” was one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever watched. Just as professor Hiltner mentioned in his video, this film puts a human face on climate change which is one reason why it is such a deeply emotional film. With footage actually filmed by community members of Paradise during the fire, the audience is enveloped in a terrifying and inescapable world that is completely surrounded by smoke, ash, and flames. Hopefully this emotional appeal will convince even the most skeptical people to make a change in their lives simply out of compassion for the people who have already faced loss and suffering due to climate change. 
             <br><br>


Although the film may not appear to be an environmental film at first glance it is quite obviously meant to inform people about climate change in many aspects. At its core this film deals with the reason why the fire was started- the negligence of PG&E. The selfishness and complete disregard of our climate that is seen in big companies is one of the most frustrating things when it comes to our struggle with combating climate change because we can start to feel powerless against these destructive giants. The film even included someone saying that, “If PG&E was an individual and not a corporation they would be in prison by now.” This statement shows the incredibly upsetting thought that corporations are almost untouchable even when they commit extremely horrible and harmful crimes that affect people’s lives. 
             <br><br>


I found that the student’s comment during lecture about Paradise being a particularly conservative area was especially impactful because it emphasizes the point that everyone will be affected by the effects of climate change. Fires and other natural disasters do not discriminate, they will destroy the homes of climate activists as well as climate deniers and everyone in between. No one will be spared from the consequences of our actions, or more accurately the absence of our actions. It is truly saddening to think that it takes a tragedy to convince some people about the severity of the climate crisis and hopefully more people will realize this fact without facing harm. If more people become educated about the effects of climate change we will be able to be more proactive than reactive when it comes to dealing with extreme weather events. 

             <br><br>

Despite being about just one of the countless number of extreme weather events to happen as a result of climate change the film was incredibly effective at showing people why they should care about our environmental actions. There are a lot of films out there that show several devastating effects of climate change which are also very effective but films that focus on just one disaster are able to be more detailed and really show the audience what it was like to be there. I think that if more people were to watch this film to see exactly what the people in Paradise had to go through they would be faced with the fact that the climate crisis is real and more importantly it is already here. 

             <br><br>

I found that the end quote that said, “Can it be worse than that? And the answer is yes.” was powerful because it reminds us that things will get even worse if we do not actively make changes. The fire in Paradise was the most destructive fire in 2018 and if we continue at the rate that we are now it will not even come close to the severity of future fires. Although it is a terrifying thought to even imagine something worse than the Camp Fire it is not something that we can choose to ignore out of fear, we need to be startled into action.

After watching the documentary film “Fire in Paradise”, I am totally shocked. In fact, I heard a lot of news about the camp fire after it happened in 2018. To be honest, I was not that shocked when I first heard this since I thought it was just another normal fire even though it was called the biggest fire in California in history. It’s really hard to imagine that this happened in the winter of Paradise City. Obviously, I was totally wrong, and this film presents me a incredible and terrible disaster that I had never seen before. 
             <br><br>
The most impressive scene to me in this film is the one that people got trapped in the fire because of the terrible traffic. It was so hopeless to be stuck in the town since they may got fired up anytime by the fire just beside them. And I feel very sad when I see the police officer talking to a family until their line ended by the fire. Although he did not mention the end of this family, from, the talk, it seems like they do not have any ways to get out of their house because there was fire everywhere in the house. The films also mentions the problem of management, not only about the escape plan but also about the administrative efficiency. There was surely problem about the communications between the fire department and the Police. If they keep their information clear and update, they may have more time to evacuate the people properly. Also, the way the police informed people to evacuate is not perfect. If all the people of Paradise were informed at the same time, more people may get out of the fire and keep alive in some ways. I’m not blaming anyone here since it was a chaos to all the people who have experienced it. However, we do need to learn lessons from this fire and prevent more lives dying because of the environmental disasters in the future.

I had no clue what I was in for when I started watching “Fire in Paradise” but afterwards my heart was filled with sympathy and fear. Being on the outside, It’s hard to really know what the people of paradise are going through. This documentary gives you the truest sense of their fear, confusion, and loss. As quick as everyone is to blame PG&E’s negligence for causing the fire, this really just shows how climate change is here and is already a serious threat. It now scares me because the next large fire could easily come through Santa Barbara and before we know it we have to evacuate. 
             <br><br>
This documentary is a reality check which I believe all Californians should see. All people should know how imminent and real this threat is and they should actively be trying to fix it or at least be prepared for it. Coming from Bakersfield we had always felt the effects of climate change and I never really knew it. We suffered from severe droughts which lasted months and our water usage was heavily monitored. As dry as we were we got lucky we didn’t suffer any fires. 
             <br><br>
Personally, I would like to thank Ken for bringing this to my attention and making me watch this documentary.

“Fire in Paradise” helps reveal how frightening the fire really was and how it affected the people around it. One thing that was I to meet with the lack of contacts for a class about climate change but he provided a nice change of pace showing the effects of wildfires. The film drew on the empathy of its viewers by showing distressing scene to show the devastation that the fire can cause

Watching this film felt like I was watching a horror movie. While I agree that it does not necessarily focus on climate change itself, the fact that we have experienced 5 of the deadliest fires on record in this past year just proves that climate change is taking place. "Fire in Paradise" takes a different perspective and captures what these people went through, and the tragedy they faced as opposed to just making them into a statistic. While these fires are broadcasted all over the news, it is hard to even imagine what these people went through. I agree it truly is frightening and plays on the empathy of the viewers. The devastation is unimaginable.

The film “Fire in Paradise” was a heartbreaking portrayal of the seriousness of the climate crisis. It was extremely difficult to watch and hear people’s accounts from when they feared they would lose their life, or at least everything they had. The most surprising thing to me was the timeframe that the fire occurred, seeing the “30, 40, minutes from ignition” on the screen really showed me how quickly the fire progressed. Additionally, I was shocked by the pitch black footage. During the time of the Paradise Fire, I assumed that the pitch black sky I saw in the news was due to the fact that the fire was at night. But after seeing this film, I know that it was due to the massive amount of smoke. 
              <br><br>
As we continue to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, these extreme weather events and climate changes will only increase. Although the film did not directly target the scientific facts, I believe that was still an effective tool to teach people about climate change. Instead of drowning people in statistics, the film showed people what will happen to their communities. This helps invoke an emotional response, which could be extremely impactful to people who may deny the facts of climate change. As Ken says, this movie puts a face to climate change, which might be the wakeup call we need.

The film portrays California as an oasis, a literal paradise on earth with amazing weather and breathtaking views of nature. The people of Concow and Paradise, for example, were to be so lucky to call California their home, however quickly we realize that this is not the case any longer. The CampFire that struck on November 8, 2018 drastically turned the lives of these residents upside down.
              <br><br>
Personally, I found myself anger the majority of time when watching the film because of negligence on behalf of PG&E and the complete incompetence of the police force. First of all, the PG&E knew about the faulty equipment and the weather forecast which post a risk for a possible wildfire yet they ignored the warning signs in order to secure a profit. The negligence would cost people their homes and for many their lives as well. It is furthermore frustrating and disturbing how the police department responded to the fire. They first brushed it off as a minor fire which could be set under control yet it wasn't, then the department assumed the fire would not cross the canyon yet it did, they then provided false information to the 911 operators and when they failed to give out an alert to every resident about the fire. The overall ineptitude is shocking because the police department's main purpose is to be the eyes and ears of the people, they are meant to protect and warn the people of any danger which might affect them but when danger presented itself, they stayed silent. For many, their silence was interpreted as there not being an actual danger to be concerned about therefore these people did not consider it an urgency to evacuate their homes although everyone else was. So when the 911 operator received a distress call from a woman crying for help because she was trapped, one can automatically assume that there is little that could be done to help her. Therefore, it feels even worse hearing this woman’s cry for help, the fear within her voice, her gasping for air and then everything coming to a silence, knowing that this poor woman had died in such a tragic and awful way. 
              <br><br>
The film focuses on the impact the climate crisis has had so far on people’s lives and it still amazes me how people still refuse to see the truth. So my question is: what tragedy has to happen until the world realizes that climate change is real? How many lives have to be lost? And when this massive even comes, is it going to be too late for humanity to make a change?

After watching the video fire in paradise, I feel really bad. I never thought the fire could be so serious and catastrophic. In the past, i used to think the fire is not very scary. People just need to make they can put it out on time. However, it is not that simple. Serious fire always cause huge economic loss and death. And now the climate change has made the fire more frequently. So from my points of view, people should take action quickly. Because the climate change is effecting us in so many different ways.

The sheer power and magnitude of this fire, and watching how it spread and the damage it caused through this documentary was truly terrifying. One of the most shocking aspects of the fire, in my opinion, was just how quickly it spread. While it first broke out early in the morning, by 10:15 am, the fire had burned 20,000 acres and was even visible from space. While overall, the fire kept burning for a few weeks, the damage it was able to cause, and lives it took within mere hours is almost incomprehensible. 
              <br><br>
Along with this, whenever there's news of a large fire, I feel as though often the news will talk about the property destruction, wilderness destruction, and evacuations that have occurred, yet there's rarely news of people dying due to the fires. However, during the Paradise fires, 85 people lost their lives, many of them elderly and unable to leave their houses. Not only did this staggering number of people die as they were unable to be rescued, but their loved ones, and everyone affected by the Paradise fire will forever be traumatized, with one interviewee comparing the death and destruction to that of 9/11. I feel that it was not only the raw emotion of those who shared their stories of trying to escape the fires, but also the live footage of the fires which truly made this documentary both terrifying, and also compelling in the sense that it should serve as a wake up call to power companies such as PG&E that they need to ensure their power lines are up to code to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again due to their laziness.

I remember this fire being all over the news but being the typical teenager I am, I really didn't pay much attention to the fire. Wild fires are sadly a common occurrence and I live in the San Gabriel Valley on the foothills of the Angeles National Forest. The biggest fire close to my home was the Colby Fire in 2014 which happened practically in my back yard. It only burned 2,000 acres which is still a large number but doesn't compare to the fire in Paradise. I somewhat grown used to wildfires because in the 8 years I have lived in that area there had been 4 fires. I never grasped the full weight of the fire until the aftermath. Hearing how many people we lost and how much was burned. This film really put into perspective how everything that could've possibly gone wrong, went wrong. Poor communication and the lack of access was the biggest issue. It really is a problem because me and my family during that fire in 2014 were never notified to evacuate when our next door neighbors were told to do so. Its a sad sight to see and living anywhere in California this can happen and it it a real problem. Climate change is the issue. The fact that fires are being normalized as they become a more common occurrence is not okay. The land is dry and we were in a record drought. Everything here in California, the place we call home, is susceptible to burning. If that doesn't scare people I'm not sure what will.

I can also relate to the fear of having a large fire so close as coming from Portland, Oregon, the 2017 gorge fire was so large that there was a significant amount of smoke in the air for weeks, and while the fire wasn't as close to my home as the Colby Fire was to yours, it was still a rather terrifying experience to think about the destruction the fire was causing. I also agree that poor communication and lack of access was a large contributor to the death and destruction which occurred, but I also believe that PG&E must be held accountable. Large energy corporations such as PG&E, with little or no regard for the excessive use of fossil fuels and the dire state of the climate in general are often able to get out of environmental trouble they cause with little or no damage to the company's name. While PG&E did have to file for bankruptcy protection following the fire, I strongly feel that far more blame, and therefore consequences needs to be placed on them for starting this devastating fire.

There are many things that I felt after watching this film, but it boils down to fear and rage. Seeing the nightmare that Paradise residents had to live through was absolutely heartbreaking, and once the fire actually stopped they had to see the result of this nightmare when their town was burned to the ground and family, friends and neighbors didn’t make it. No one anticipates such a hell to happen to them, and once people understood what was actually happening it was too late. I can’t blame the citizens nor the firefighters/police force involved with the fire, because no one could truly grasp how dire the situation was. Even with the updated 2015 evacuation plan, no one knew that a fire of this caliber could happen, and no one could justify spending millions of dollars on roads that would most likely not be used. Yet, this is now our reality, and people are now understanding that climate change is going to take all of these natural disasters and multiply them to where it doesn’t seem natural. Whatever planning or precautions have been previously made, it’s not enough for our warming planet.

              <br><br>

 While I cannot place blame on the residents of paradise or police force, I absolutely can place blame on PG&E. A company with that much money and power needs to understand its influence on the environment they’re in and the people around them. They knew the power should not have been on. They knew that their power lines were outdated. They simply just did not care about the consequences of their actions. Corporations like PG&E need to take climate change seriously because their old patterns will blaze a trail of waste and destruction. If they continue this way, they will ruin the lives of the very people that gave them the money to become as powerful as PG&E is today.

Watching “Fire in Paradise” was a weird experience for me because I am from about 45 minutes outside of Paradise, I was there for the Camp Fire, I was lucky to get evacuated, and got to witness this tragedy first hand. There is really no way to quickly convey my experience other than saying me and my family were lucky, it was a heartbreaking experience that seemed to never end, and there are so many heartbreaking stories that don’t get told. This fire is so personal to so many people, it changed so many lives and really made me question what I can control. I wish that the intensity that I feel for that disastrous week, people would feel about climate change. I wish that the pitty and sympathy people feel for survivors of a natural disaster would transfer over to fighting climate change to help give our future generations a chance. 

              <br><br>

This film did a good job transferring a piece of the emotions felt from that incident over to the viewers. The personal anecdotes were heart-wrenching and so similar to some of my friends. It was educational to see that incident from a broader perspective. That experience was never tied to climate change for me because it was so emotional and terrifying. I am glad it is now though because I want climate change to be treated as a personal and terrifying issue. I just hope that people won't have to survive a fire to understand climate change's importance.

I can imagine how being that close to Paradise would affect you differently than someone like me who lives in California, but not nearly as close to the Camp Fire. I also pity the people that lost their homes and loved ones and also wish that the feelings those people had would transfer to everyone to an extent in that they could better understand climate change emotionally. What I mean when I say that is I wish people would have more passion about fighting climate change. I sometimes find myself becoming desensitized of statistics about the temperature rising and how many acres were scorched in fires because I hear about it so often, and big numbers often are incomprehensible for people to truly understand. Before watching Fire in Paradise, I had just thought of it as another deadly fire than burned x hundred thousand acres in California, but after the film, I felt much more passionate about fighting climate change because the anecdotes of the film touched me.
              <br><br>


I definitely don't want anyone to experience the wrath of climate change as the people in Paradise did in order for them to begin making changes to their life to protect our earth; however, I think films like Fire in Paradise does the trick to catalyze the process of truly making people change their lifestyles in order to combat climate change. Climate documentaries educate and inform viewers about climate change with a visual medium, but more importantly, they influence the audience emotionally that I think is more effective. Capturing the devastating effects of climate change has an unequivocal effect on audiences that statistics and the written word simply cannot have.

The film, “Fire in Paradise” made me have the feelinmg with who were influenced by the Paradise fire. Instead of proving again and again and provide the data and statements made by professionals, this documentory shows the true consquences of global warming, to combine what the dirrector want to say into just one real disaster. It lets me to understand the extremely difficult results created by the wild fire. It is not only the threaten towards the house and possession, but the real life, both human and the lives who share the earth with us.

I think this film has an intense opening scene, as the camera pans to the dry forest, the answering machine and robocall helps to establish the scene. The voice-over such as “Extreme weather conditions and high fire danger are forecasted in Butte County, starting Thursday, November 8, 2018.” The movie continues to show a series of montage sequences with families, a man fishes, kids, and couples as the PG&E announce that they have to turn off power in the neighborhood. 
              <br><br>

The  powerful opening scene shows how global warming affects our community and ordinary people. The rest of the film, filled with an interview with residents, showed their real reaction when they encountered fire and how they are scared. It shows how powerless when the 911 received the phone call from the victim, they can’t do anything to help instead of answering the phone call. The film shows how human beings are vulnerable when facing disasters. Although the Paradise city had a done enough evacuation plan to fight with such forest fire, there are still many people suffered and died. It is heartbreaking people didn’t get more information from the authority about how to sever the campfire was. The film forecast the human condition in the future, and give a lesson for us. It is up to us to decide our density and how to act in the future.
              <br><br>

I think the company like PG&E held the responsibility to the campfire, and they should do some maintenance for their transmission tower,  it is immoral and irresponsible to only care about their money and interest and careless about the death of human and continues devastating our environment.

I felt sorry for my roommate as I was watching this film because it seemed as if every five minutes I was letting out a slew of strongly worded curses about how this whole tragedy could have been prevented after hearing yet another outrageous fact about the sheer negligence that let to the severity of the fire Paradise Fires. Many things angered me to no end, number one being how PG&E chose to ignore the safety concerns regarding their structures causing the incident that initially sparked the fire. Furthermore, once the fire had sparked and slowly proceeded to its height it was so frustrating to hear that the city's alert system had not been configured in time to alert every resident about immediate evacuation, something that lead to many unnecessary deaths that were 100% preventable. Hearing the story of the girl whose grandfather was alone protecting his ranch before succumbing to the fire due to the missing alerts tugged at my heartstrings and made me sick to think about that poor man all alone forced to die by the negligence of other people. His story as well as the one about the woman who was frantically calling her partner to tell him she loved him for what seemed to be the last time due to being caught in the thick of the fire really were difficult to listen to, and only heightened the anger I had about this whole ordeal.
              <br><br>

Hearing that PG&E was known for having multiple safety code violations in the past with little to no repercussions was not a shock to me since I understand that powerful companies can often find ways to evade taking responsibility when problems occur, but one thing that a man in the film said really struck a cord with me to put this issue into perspective. When he discussed how if PG&E was a person rather than a full fledged company there would be no question about putting that individual in jail, it really opened my eyes about the way we as a society let large companies fail at taking accountability for their actions letting them get away with such harrowing crimes such as this one. When actual lives are at stake and the safety of the environment is placed at risk due to greed and negligence, someone needs to answer for it. We cannot let these things happen in the future lest we let these big powerful entitites believe that they are untouchable and never to blame.

The film was very informative and tragic as we were shown the devastation by the one of the greatest fires to have ravaged through California. Having been a resident of California for all of my life, fires and earthquakes have always been the greatest of worries. However, I have never personally experienced a major natural disaster myself, but this film really showed me the horrific and tragic nature of a fire that was beyond control. Seeing the panic stricken accounts of the survivors and those who sadly lost loved ones in the fire really saddened me. However, this film demonstrated the need for taking care of our planet as these types of disasters have been increasingly occurring during our time. It was frustrating to see the mass destruction that was caused by a PG&E tower. There was negligence in making sure that the equipment was in a good state, especially during a period of less humidity, strong winds, and the fact that it was in an area that had a history of wild fires. Furthermore, I felt that there was blame to be brought onto the local authorities as they failed to supply accurate information to the public effectively and efficiently. They made a wrong judgement on the severity of the fire and it cost lives as aid was deployed in a delayed and haphazardly manner. I personally felt frustrated listening to the interviewers with the local authorities as they all repeated sentences along the lines of "we did not see it as big of a threat" or "we had plans in the event of a rapidly growing fire but nothing of this extent". What really struck me was the lack of response to the question if it should have been envisioned or considered what the plan would be in the case of a fire as destructive as the Camp Fire. I felt that this displayed a lack of responsibility and care due to the fact that nothing like this has happened before so there would never be e need to prepare for it. I felt that this is very ignorant in comparison to the changing climate, such as greater amounts of droughts and greater brush. The environment is changing due to anthropogenic causes yet we choose to continue our lives in the same manner as if nature will adapt to our impacts on the environment. In fact, it should rightly be viewed as the other way around. People have greatly devastated the planet and we should take responsibility in amending these issues brought about or change our ways for the betterment of the planet and future generations. If we continue to see disasters such as the Camp Fire as a rare occurrence or something that happened by chance, many more lives will be lost and the planet will continue to decay until it is too late.

In the documentary, "Fire in Paradise" I was emotionally disturbed. To be blunt, I left the documentary feeling angry. I felt angry at big companies such as PG&E and the numerous fossil fuel companies around the world, I was angry at our congress and our lobbyists, and above all, I was angry at the general public. Time and time again I feel people only make change or participate in change when it is necessary. Why wait? So you can live a slightly better life for the time being? It never made sense to me. As Professor Hiltner stated, wildfires are growing in size, strength, and occurrence. We get why big companies won't do anything, it's the money. What bothers me is that the mass majority of people always look to blame these few companies at the top and only do so when tragedy strikes. It's astonishing what the average person can do if they can collectively work together with those in their community and even those across the globe. All in all, I enjoyed the documentary and how it specifically highlighted how fast and how out of control the fire was. I can't imagine what it was like for those involved in the fire but one thing I know without a doubt is that the Paradise community is now closer then ever and I am sure you will see they will be some of the very first responders of climate change snd things alike in the coming years...

First off, this documentary was my first exposure to this tragic natural disaster. Well, I call them human-made disasters now because there's nothing natural about humans killing our environment causing extreme weather conditions and setting the stage for stage "6" hurricanes and fires in dry place.. (prayers up to Australia too). I felt the sorry and sob stories of some of the near-death survivors and I'm amazing that one lady found god, also known as the rear of a fire engine. 
              <br><br>

As a State Parks Lifeguard who hasn’t been trained through a section of the Fire Department, I  work with many Permanent Lifeguards and Park Rangers (who have graduated from the police department) as well as some retired firefighters who have amazing life stories and granted medals of honors from previous presidents. Being around many first responders during tragedies and who go to work every day not knowing what the world will throw at them, I relate to those working in public service/public safety. Watching this video, its easy to point fingers at the rescue units putting their lives on the line for not saving everyone, but remember they are human. Many firefighters sacrifice their lives, and do so with pride and courage, never with the dishonor of being "shot in the back." One of my fellow lifeguard's, Ben Carlson, last moments in life was strapping the buoy around a beachgoer before a 15+ foot set wave hit them, and the person with the buoy floated back up and was saved, while he did not come back up. Watching this story, I feel we should all keep in mind that life's a gift and not certain, and those first responders on the front line did everything they could during that day in the office. I feel we should not shame these people for not saving everyone, because its much easy to forget about what is lost, and not who was saved. There was helpless people and no physically possible way to act and help them. That’s why this is a tragedy, not because the people failed to do their job. 
              <br><br>

I do have an issue with the telephone operators at Paradise Police 911 Dispatch. The CalFire reporters on the other side of the phone were grossly misinformed of the gravity and threat of the situation. When Calfire said, "Yes, [the fire] is North of Concal." It sent chills down my back. This mistake is the reason the people of Paradise were delayed to evacuate and the evacuation plan failed with tremendous chaos. That was atrocious to watch the lack of awareness, messages, and alert systems informing Paradise's residence to run for their lives. This delay and rapid moving fire was recipe for disaster. I am not trying to persuade anyone that the causalities were acceptable, because they were completely unacceptable and everyone should have fled that area well before the fire hit. The people calling the shots have some serious guilt on their shoulders, and it will affect the rest of their lives and their jobs will be much different now. However, I want to say thank you for the Firefighters and Policeman who tried their best and put themselves in harms way.

This documentary was really emotional as well as anger evoking. First of all, from the many innocent lives lost, like the girl’s grandfather and another girl’s mother. I sympathize with these people, as a person who is also really close his mother, I would be scared even just thinking about losing her, but this video showed me that us as humans are vulnerable. But what enrages me is the fact that even though us as individuals are vulnerable, together, we become malicious. PG&E takes a perfect advantage of such characteristics and sacrifice their morality in return for profit, and when the consequences come, they are still reluctant to admit their fault. Most people think they are save until the danger actually comes, but due to the current conditions of climate change, we are all in danger, no matter where we live, there would always be a possibility that some sort of “natural” disaster destroys everything we’ve worked for. It is heart breaking for the people in Paradise, it is also ironic that in a matter of hours paradise became the direct opposite of its name.

Watching the “Fire in Paradise” truly broke my heart, watching the people struggle to escape the town and hearing the 911 calls of people who were trapped in their homes and the terror in their voice not knowing if they were going to make it out alive is just horrible. And the worst part about of all this is the fact that as time goes on and climate change gets worse, these fires will only get bigger and more devastating. As the temperatures continue to get higher and higher, places will only get drier and fries will become intense and severe. I just wonder how many more fires it will take for people to realize that something about the way we are living needs to change.

In this documentary, survivors recall the devastating forest fire of 2018. The
disaster flattened paradise, making it the deadliest wildfire in California's
history. In the autumn of 2018, there are several fires in the north and south
of California at the same time, the two largest of which are the mountain
fire that has burned Paradise town north of San Francisco in Northern
California and the Woolsey mountain fire west of Los Angeles in Southern
California with relatively light disaster. The campfire started from a wildfire
near Paradise Town, a two-hour drive north of SF. From a single spark to a
seemingly unstoppable conflagration, people lived and died instantly. The
strong smoke caused by the strong wind was clearly photographed by NASA
satellites in space. The fire spread rapidly on the ground, and many people had
only a few minutes to escape. What impresses me is that we also closed classes
that year, so I decided to go back to China. At that time, I was on the 101-freeway
road to lax, which was full of smoke and fire. This was not the paradise of
California that I knew, but a scene of hell. After driving to Ventura, we were
told that 101 was blocked and we could only drive to Los Angeles by a long
mountain way. This is just my impression of a person who has not been seriously
affected by the fire. It's hard to imagine that thousands of families have lost
their homes in this disaster, which is very terrible. Now Australia has also
set off a raging mountain fire. We should pay more attention to the safety of
fire in the wild, so as not to let a barbecue ruin the homes of countless
people.

To be completely honest, my immediate reaction after watching “Fire in Paradise” was to call all my friends and family to tell them how much I love them and how much they mean to me.  This film was a heart-wrenching, beautiful reminder of how sacred life is and how we have no control over the force of nature.  I was brought to tears by the clips of those who lost loved ones and amazed by the strength of human connection in such dire circumstances.  
              <br><br>


In general, I was left in shock by the movie.  Although I knew the Paradise fire was extremely detrimental, I was not aware of its completely unprecedented nature.  Between the rate it spread, the lack of information given to the community, and the impossibility of evacuating everyone, the devastation to the land and the public was so much greater than I realized.  This left me with a sense of dread for the future of wildfires.  I was also appalled by the lack of responsibility PG&E took in regards to the fire; I think that if big corporations continue to act with negligence and disrespect it will result in even more catastrophes.  I was also surprised that I had not learned of the true nature of this fire before watching the film.  With the rate of climate change increasing and the globe becoming more prone to events of this nature, it amazes me that we are not acting faster to reduce our carbon footprint.  I think that events like this are downplayed in order to reduce public alarm although they should be conveyed exactly like they are to warn the population that we are truly in the midst of a crisis like no other.

I can’t possibly express how identical my reaction was to the film to yours. It was saddening to see how quick an event like this can come about and take away so much all at once. I was most surprised with how fast the fire spread and how slow the community was informed about what to do. You cannot always predict how a wildfire will spread, but can always take better precautions. I also did not realize how severe the fire was until watching over this film and much like you said, I dreadful of wildfires because of how little you can do about it. I am bothered that the state I have lived in my entire life has experienced such extreme wildfires in the past decade, but almost no dramatic changes regarding the climate crisis fight have been made. If action is not taken it will only become worse and I do not want to leave my family with a planet where this is considered to be normal or expected. Your last point of your comment is something that I strongly believe and quite honestly live by. I say this because you should not make disasters like this seem smaller than what it really is. The population, especially the ones in danger, should be properly informed of the severity of the subject. This seems as though it should be common knowledge, but unfortunately that is not the case. Lastly, I appreciate how you called out PG&E along with other big corporations as they are not held accountable and continue to neglect the issues that they bring upon our environment. Overall this film was very sad to sit through for several reasons, but I hope it gets more attention as time goes on.
<br><hr>
My reaction was much like Olivia's as I too, felt the urge to call my family and check up on them. To see the way families were ripped apart and how some chose to stay due to a false sense of security was devastating. I feel like sometimes I hear about these devastating events and understand how terrible they are, but I still feel this sense of  being disconnected from the situation. To actually hear from survivors and have them tell us how bad it was and how they lost family, made it so much more real for me. This could very well be my family and I as we reside in California. This film also made me feel more grateful toward firefighters and 911 operators that in spite of all the hardships do their best to help out the community.
               <br><br>

Like you I was aware that the Camp Fire had occurred and had seen these insane clips of people escaping and yet  I still could not grasp just how massive and destructive this fire was. While I understand that Cal Fire and the city of Paradise were preparing themselves for fires, I feel like a fire like this should have been something along the lines of what they should have anticipated. Fires around California like the Thomas Fire should have rang warning bells for places like Paradise and Concow where fires break out often. Not to mention, the county should have released an official evacuation order that could have saved the life of those who chose to stay because they were not aware of just how dangerous the situation was. Climate Change is only going to get worse from here and we need to act now to avoid a future where fires like the Thomas and Camp Fire become a norm.
               <br><br>

While the county is to a certain degree at fault for not preparing better, the biggest thing to blame is PG&E. The lines in Concow had not been updated and failed because of that. I don't understand how they are allowed to continue to function seeing all the numerous safety violations they continue to break. PG&E should compensate all those affected by the fire and be forced to address all lines that could possibly produced another fire like the one that happened in Paradise. The world is only getting hotter and we need to act now before we reach the tipping point.

"Fire in Paradise", unlike many other climate change films, focuses on one single aspect of climate change- forest fires. By dedicating a film introducing only one aspect of climate change, the film made it easier for me to truly digest and picture the magnitude of destruction the future of the world will face, since forest fires are only one of the many disasters stemming from climate change. Seeing the actual footage and real people's accounts of the wildfire was absolutely terrifying and devastating. I was absolutely enraged and disgusted by the lack of responsibility PG&E decided to take, before and after the camp fire. Even before the camp fire, PG&E was responsible for setting off countless other forest fires due to its negligence to maintain lawful upkeep of its power lines. I simply cannot fathom how this corporation can overlook the previous destructions its power lines have caused and yet continue to use power lines beyond their expiration dates, letting the lives of countless people rest on chance. However, like the film conveys, it is not possible to  put an entire corporation behind bars. So my question is who do we hold accountable when decisions are made by big corporations to disregard the lives of others? We can no longer allow mass murderers to dodge the prosecution of law and hide behind the front of a corrupt corporation!

Even though I have heard how destructive, how horrible the fire was to California in China two years ago, I have no idea about the real situation the citizens were suffering before I watched the documentary “Fire in Paradise”. Researchers explained the reason for the destructive fire at the beginning of the documentary:  climate change prolonged the draught and factors like high winds and high temperatures are combined into the package; then, fire is like a match which was being threw into the package to generate the catastrophe. Then, it shifts the focus to the interviews with the survivals and the officials who witnessed the fire, people who suffered the irreversible ache the fire brought to them. As the majority of the documentary is devoted to the horrible results the fire brought, I highly believe that one of the intentions of the documentary is to utilize the horrible consequence of the fatal fire to warn us to pay attention to the climate change. To be honest, my cognition to the fire evacuation is superficial: since each place has its own evacuation plan, once the landscape is on fire, people will get a warning and drive their cars away to the safe place in order. But the assumption is too naive. Once the place catches fire, people are in panic. All of them are rush to leave the place, which will cause heavy traffic along the road and the evacuation plan is useless. The police and firefighters have nothing to do as well. The documentary widens our cognition to the bloodcurdling results the fire would bring, which is an effective way to remind us the climate change is closely related to our lives. Most of us are reluctant to accept the theory the scientists put forth about the climate change in that like professor Hiltner mentioned in the lecture, most of us still remain our cognition on climate change is the rise of the sea level, which is far away from us since at least now we are not under threat. Nevertheless, the documentary unveil ed the real damage the change of climate will bring, a way to call us to take some action immediately to reduce the damage we done to the earth.

"Fire in Paradise" apparently shows us that we are not alarmed enough to the damages caused by climate changes. It is shocked to see that how people living nearby the wildfire ranges have to face the 'natural' disaster without getting any forecast report. The reason why they were put in such dangerous and life-threatening situation is because we did not put in enough attention toward the global warming effects. It is really sad to see that how electrical company "PG&E" putting their interests in front of all those innocent people's lives, and the wire might be the reason causing destructive incident. 
               <br><br>

It is hard to believe that the fire is a such life-threatening thing, when I first saw the side of the mountain nearby UCSB lightening up, I have never connected it to lives of residents live at that area. But truly fire has became a severe disaster which might take away lives of people in California every year. 
               <br><br>

This class really does help me understand more of global warming effects and alert students that we should do more to stop, to minimize of it. Hopefully, under common efforts, the situation we facing now will get better in the future.

This documentary was scary, sad, and gut wrenching. The speed and intensity at which the Camp Fire spread was astonishing and hard to watch even in a documentary a year later. Fires today are a different animal; they are bigger, stronger, and more frequent because of climate change. This led the town of Paradise to be completely burned through in four hours and the loss of homes of 30,000 people. This fire was caused by two main factors: climate change and PG&E. Climate change has caused warming and a longer drought season. Fires now don’t occur until November, December, or January and when fires hit during these months, water hasn’t hit the ground in many months. Considering this danger, it is disparaging that PG&E didn’t make a point of adhering to safety standards with their electricity towers because a PG&E power line started the fire, leaving it up to the fate of our climate. I am especially aware of the danger of fires today because I was in Idyllwild for a chamber music camp during the Cranston fire. The fire moved so quickly that by the time I was finally on my down the mountain, it was less than a mile and a half away. There were only two working roads up and down Idyllwild at the time and one was blocked because of the fire so there was only one way down the mountain, which is absolutely terrifying now that I am thinking about it. Fires today are a scary beast and we need to show them more respect.

Before watching this film, I did not realize that high winds contributed to fires. I thought that the only real reason we get more fires with climate change is because vegetation is more dried out. I was shocked to learn how the fire began with wires melting metal due to them touching via the wind. I thought this was interesting as I knew that recently PG&E shut off power in the Bay Area, where I am from, for many days, as they were worried about the wind strength. I thought that this was to avoid other problems, not that it would cause a fire. 

               <br><br>

Another thing that stood out to me was the way Paradise was evacuated. It was so sad to listen to the phone calls to 911 where the dispatcher was telling them that it was not time to evacuate yet, and that may have been reason for many deaths. Seeing such a personal moment really makes the climate crisis hit home as we see how it is effecting these people's lives in such a drastic way, and that their life is about to change forever. It's hard to fathom getting trapped by a wildfire. The way fires are portrayed, you lose your belongings and home, but your life is not expected to be lost in a fire. However, this is not the truth, and Paradise is an example of this, and proves that climate caused fires are a threat to us.

I really enjoyed the documentary. I liked the fact that it was a real event, real proof, that climate change is effecting the world very drastically. I used to live near to Paradise/ northern california and I have had direct contact with fires in norther california. I lived about 20 minutes from the butte fire and had to miss school due to the air condition so I  could in a way relate to those who were threatened by the fire, of course on a much lower scale. I remember the sky being black and going out of my car in the morning and having ashes all over my car. Having the movie this week  be this documentary was very impactfu i believe and being able to truly see climate change being dangerous and in action is the best way to make people see climate change as a large issue. I truly sympathize with this film and it has touched me greatly. I think this movie can effectivly get the message across to any class/ population that climate change is real and I think seeing events that people from california can directly relate too makes a big difference.

The film “A Fire in Paradise” does an excellent job of using a combination of actual footage, personal recounts, and academic information to show the audience just how devastating the fires were. The footage and commentary will appeal to the audience’s emotions, urging them to do something about the devastation that is climate change, while the academic information will back up any claims, preventing any argument of how climate change is not a man-made issue.

The documentary “Fire in Paradise” is totally shocking and terrifying. The real scenes of the Camp Fire recorded by survivors scared me. Even I could not believe that people could survive from this huge fire, not to mention people who were actually suffering it. I should say that everyone is brave, and they should be really proud of themselves. It is a big challenge not only for them but also for the whole of humanity, the whole world. This actually happened event seems to be the last wakeup call for each individual. The consequences we can see in the documentary are really catastrophic and overwhelming: the whole town was in a mess and everything was destroyed into ruin; over eighty people died in this disaster; citizens lost their house and their property; and many things came that need to be dealt with and fixed, like the arrangements of these survivors. It’s tragic, but also reflectional. People who depicted what they met and experienced in the documentary really move me and excite my emotions. It is an incident that I never meet, and I can never have the same mood as they felt during this disaster. However, I can feel how sad they are and how scared about Campfire through watching.
               <br><br>

We should learn a lesson from this fire, or all fires happened in California. The climate and weather are so worse that there is a large probability that another fire will come, and we cannot predict when it will come. How can we fight with huge fires just like this one? Can we also pull over future disasters? What will be the effects and aftermath? Can we predict? These are all things that people should consider and think about. What we can do is not waiting for another fire, or natural disaster, but changing the situation and climate crisis. We can change or mitigate it through our daily life through our little efforts and power. In this case, although we may not prevent the next fire, we can minimize the consequences brought and we can be prepared.

As I watched Fire in Paradise, I realized how closely the fires had been to my home and how the catastrophic consequences of climate change will soon be felt. Although I was in English 22 and have learned a lot about climate change in the past two quarters, climate change was such a large general concept that it still felt abstract and far off. However, coming from Northern California myself, watching the documentary really resonated with me and realize that we cannot delay action any longer. Watching the movie and watching Ken’s associated lecture felt like watching some kind of end of the world apocalyptic movie like “2012.” Watching actual footage of the fire spreading with such speed and intensity and listening to Ken talk about the landslides in Montecito that hurled entire boulders at ~20 mph left me in shock at how real and severe the situation has gotten.
               <br><br>

I live about a 2 hr drive away from napa/sonoma, yet I still remember the effects of the fires. I remember going outside and finding it difficult to breathe, and watching the smoke engulf the air in a foggy haze. If I, in a city 2 hrs away from the fire, was suffering the consequences, I can’t even imagine the magnitude of destruction the fire had on the people that were directly affected. 
               <br><br>
It really frustrates me how Trump and other politicians refuse to acknowledge climate change as a true issue. Its always easy to think “oh that’ll never happen to me” until it actually happens and you are forced to suffer the consequences of your complacency. I feel like they will not take action until those events end up happening to them, and even then they might deflect the blame onto something else in order to protect their political reputations.

The film “Fire in Paradise” was a heartbreaking and sad film that does a great job of explaining how events occurred through the multiple survivors perspectives. Although the cause of the fire was due to PG&E, climate change still played a huge part on the fast spread of the fire. According to the film the fires spread 80 football fields per minute. This was mostly due to the dry land and strong winds. It was sad to see how some people were not able to make it out of the fire and how many left their cars in the middle of the street when attempting to leave because of how close the fires were. The part of the film where the hospital is beginning to burn down while staff is trying to evacuate everyone in their personal vehicles was heartbreaking. 

               <br><br>

The Thomas Fire was one of California's largest fires and something one of my professors from a different class mentioned was that one of the possible reasons as to why this fire spread so fast was because of the plants our SB county planted after a fire occurred a couple years back. The plants were an African native species that did not do well here in sunny Santa Barbara. They eventually dried out and died way sooner than expected and when that species of plants dies it serves as kindling. By taking the cheap way out and not doing some research before buying these inexpensive plants that were not going to thrive in our environment our city let us down.

               <br><br>

With that being said PG&E and our county has the money to fix these things but instead of investing this money on people's safety they are investing it on other things that are most likely harming our environment too. Santa Barbara for instance claims to want to be a sustainable city but is a supporter of the oil drilling that is happening. Unfortunately as civilians we only have so much power to create change and although it is contributing towards something positive we need these higher authoritative figures to open their eyes and help out as well.

After watching the film, I felt heartbreaking and frustrated that so many people have suffered in this disaster. Overall the film conveyed a real documentary and give us a real insight of the fire. Also, the film also provide us both a storytelling way and also give us some useful knowledge in order to provide clear explanation of reason that has caused the wildfire. 
               <br><br>

From my perspective, this film should give each of us a lesson that it is important to protect our environment and it is necessary to learn some useful self protection tips

I agree that the film had a very strong call to action when it came to ending. It emphasized that global warming was indeed very impactful, but the more important portion of the movie was the feelings of people. The thing about humans is that their selfishness always gets the best of them, and the fact that the documentary series filmed the movie in a way so that they were a lot of emotions being felt constantly. It made people unhappy and absolutely shattered during the fire and after, and that sentiment has ranged into the lives of us who actually have the power to make a change before we are affected by the same thing.

A good amount of people from my high school and some of my best friends live in Butte County which were impacted by the Paradise Fire. They sent me videos of the orange and dark red skies and the smoky prolonged days. All them needed to evacuate because of the dangerous air quality. Watching this film really showed me how chaotic this event was. I was very saddened for the town, the families, and the environment. It was so hard to believe that something like this can happen so fast but the movie does a great job of picturing the time of the event. As the audience, I emotions were going on a rollercoaster. My breathing stopped during the evacuations of the hospital because of how intense that series event was. 
               <br><br>


This film's main focus wasn't really about climate change but as an audience it should come to mind that climate change is the cause of this. The increase in temperatures is what causes these fires to start and how wild it gets. This film showed me what it's like to lose something so fast from a catastrophe thats so destructive and deadly. I would be very devastated if my house burned down with my possessions but in that situation my family is the number one priority.

Fire Paradise               <br><br>

This film was very hard to watch. If nothing else could change your mind about climate change, then maybe this film could. There’s no doubt in my mind that the combination of carelessness from PG and E as well as the weather changes as a result of climate change are the main offenders in the Paradise Fire. While PBS did a good job in creating this film about the fire in Paradise, I think I prefer the Netflix film Fire in Paradise. Was climate change the sole reason for this enormous catastrophe? I don’t think it was the only reason, however I think that it probably played the biggest role. As the firefighters mentioned in the Frontline film, the combination of an extremely dry climate, very high winds, and no precipitation in the area for almost eight months was definitely the key factor. Unfortunately, to add to this problem, the authorities in Paradise did not have a viable evacuation plan. Many people were trapped on roads due to heavy traffic and others were simply never notified of the grave danger of the fire. Fires like the one in paradise are becoming more and more common as a result of climate change, and there’s really no denying that. In fact during the film one of the climate scientists had mentioned that four of the five largest fires had happened all within the past decade. The Thomas fire was the largest ever in the Ventura/Santa Barbara county. It was also one of the most destructive, clearing around 281,000 acres. This fire affected many people, both rich and poor. I agree with Ken when he says that the effects of climate change are upon us right now. There are so many questions that go through my head when I realize that things are only getting worse. Temperatures are rising, droughts are worsening, and people seem to be perfectly happy in their ignorance. Why? Don’t Americans, especially those of us living in California, realize the effects that climate change is having in our own backyard? We need to start taking action if we are to prevent more fires like the one that destroyed the town of Paradise.

The documentary “Fire in Paradise” was so surreal. Having lived in California all of my life, and seeing how much we are in a drought and how it has horrible effects on our land. Especially in the case of people who live in the valley area of Southern California, in the High Desert, having a high risk of being endangered because of threats of wildfires. This catastrophic disaster with the Paradise Fire where the fire began miles away from the city and ended up jumping across the canyons and highways reminds me of one year back home. In the 2016-2017 school year, I remember getting an alert on my phone of possible evacuation for my city because of three fires that broke out 15-20 miles away from the city. School was canceled, stores were closing early, and traffic was horrible on the freeway because of all the families evacuating early just in case the fire spread to where we were.
<br><br>
After watching this documentary, I came to realize and understand how much our government doesn’t really care about us. When President Trump addressed the Paradise Fire at one of his speeches, he took it as a joke. First off he said the wrong city, and then was continuously corrected with the right name, Paradise, and he still couldn’t pronounce the correct city. And then above all, he blamed the fire on an overgrowth of trees, and still not coming to the consensus that this was due to drought and lack of rainfall. This all falls back on the rise of temperatures, the droughts, and how much carbon we are putting into our atmosphere. After all of the wildfires happening up and down California, and the evidence that proves climate change and global warming is a real phenomenon he is still stupid enough to call it a hoax and that everything we hear about it is “Fake News.” How much more will we have to burn, and watch our world grow hotter in order for him to come out and accept the fact that we have been in a climate crisis for years now?

The fact that any of this even happened is absolutely astonishing. Watching this film left me in shock. I remember hearing about this fire around the same time as the Woolsey Fire, but since it was much further from home, I never learned too much about it. Looking at it about a year later opened my eyes to how truly devastating the Camp Fire was. This film did a fantastic job showing how the fire progressed and how it only took a few hours until this fire was able to destroy all of Paradise. The craziest thing to me is how fast the fire was spreading. It started as a tiny fire and the fire department knew about it. Little did they know this fire would end up spreading at almost 4 miles/hour. They could have stopped it so early on but they just didn't have the resources necessary to do so. As the film went on, we saw how hectic and chaotic the town ended up. It seemed like a movie. One part that stood out to me was when one firefighter went out in a bulldozer to push cars out of the way and clear the road. It seemed so crazy to do this, but it ended up saving lots of lives. The Camp Fire was not just a climate crisis issue, but also an urban planning issue. The climate crisis will soon force towns and cities to plan for the absolute worst -- to plan for something like what happened in Paradise.

The documentary “Fire in Paradise” had my emotions all over the place, in one moment I was shocked at how fast the fire was moving, then scared of how close it actually was to people, and sad of the deaths that occurred. I wasn’t even there to witness it and I was legitimately in tears when the people were telling their stories. In the back of my mind I kind of recall this happening but what I didn’t know was how destructive the fire actually was, I mean an entire town was burned to the ground, homes, schools, hospitals, just gone in a matter of hours. What really kind of had me uneasy was that the fire department used a system called “Code Red” to notify people to evacuate. But they knew that the amount of people that had signed up was low, and out of those who did sign up, some didn’t even receive an alert. I know that they couldn’t hit the “notify all” button because that would’ve caused even more of a traffic jam, so it really just wasn’t a good situation to be in. 
<br><br>



Although the fire wasn’t due climate change, but more so human error, I liked that it was included in the course material because it lets one see that we are the ones who cause damage to the earth. We are the ones polluting the air, oceans, and streets of our own home. We are the ones who are responsible for all of the bad that’s to come in the near future.

After wathcing the film "Fire In Paradise", I was kind of shocked by it. Having born and living up in China, I had never seen or evern considered about the effect and travel speed 
of wild fire. Before I get to California, I was told that Ca is affected by wild fire from time to time but I never considered it to be a big deal. However the film inform me about the 
high travel speed of wild fire that people could hardly have time to defend it. As what is also mentioned in the vedio, people always think they get time to defend the sea level rise,
we would get time to build seveels or something while there's actually not. The bad effect of wild fire in the film seems to be leaded by the company, however the climate change 
take the biggest charactor who caused most of the wild fire in the world.
<br><br>

The films shows directly about the bad outcomes of wild fire that might be caused by climate change to its viewers instead of only digits found by doing researches. Hopefully more
people could pay attention to the effects of climate change and take action to protect the environment.

I don't know if it's best to say that I enjoyed this film. I found it moving and heartbreaking and disappointing while still a well done film. The personal stories were tragic and frightening and while I personally have little home-tie to California, it was impactful on a very local level. I wish they had gone in greater detail about how it was that climate change had created the circumstances and setting for such a deadly fire. 

<br><br>

The other thing that I found saddening was the low amount of preparation that the town had for a disaster and the slow respondence telling people to leave. While it is true that each man's life is their own and that they are responsible for it, in the American culture, there is a dichotomy of trust and distrust of authority where on one hand people will avoid/ignore police and bend rules when it comes to daily things, disobeying them when they think that they know better, and on the other hand, they will wait in licking distance of flames until someone says "it's not safe to be here, get out" before they even leave their homes. Tragic.

While watching "Fire in Paradise", I felt an increasing sense of anxiety as the time since the fire started flashed across the screen, knowing what was going to happen to Paradise in such a short time. One aspect of the fire that scared me was how quickly it switched from "not something Paradise had to worry about" to a town-wide evacuation while the actual city was on fire.This was mirrored in the film as the idyllic footage of Paradise before the fire was juxtaposed with the inferno that destroyed the entire community. I can only imagine how awful the operators must feel, knowing that they told one caller "this is not a situation to panic about" in one minute and then having to switch over to saying "every person in Paradise MUST evacuate" the next; knowing that all of the previous callers may have had their chance to secure their homes and their safety taken from them due to a lack of updated information. This was the first video in the class that made me outwardly emotional; the scene of the evacuation of the hospital was heartbreaking, and I cried when hearing that the nurses took their own babies' car seats out of their personal vehicles so they could move their patients to safety.

<br><br>

"Fire in Paradise" also continues the theme that the negligence of officials and corporations make climate change worse for average civilians. While climate change makes California's droughts longer, summers hotter, and fire seasons larger, if PG&E had replaced their old equipment, or barring the "monumental" effort that would take, turned off the power on high-risk days, the Camp Fire probably would not have started. Additionally, the fact that Paradise officials knew that the entire town could not evacuate in a timely manner and yet were willing to not execute all of the modifications to make it possible made me sick. If I were someone responsible for the well-being of a community of people, and a disaster like the Camp Fire happened on my watch, I would absolutely spend the rest of my life knowing that I had my city's blood on my hands. The Camp Fire really was "the perfect storm", so to speak; a more effective plan to wipe out a city could not have been composed by human minds. In the time of the climate crisis, we now NEED to be prepared for fighting inaccessible fires and evacuating massive amounts of people in the midst of an emergency if we want to preserve as many lives as we can. If we don't prepare, we need to remember that there will be a Camp Fire and a Paradise lost every year in California from here on out.

I completely agree with your point of view. This documentary changes my opinion about natural disasters. Once I only thought that those horrific scenes can only be seen in disaster movies. The most lasting impression that the documentary gives me is when people are evacuating the hospital. People are surrounded by dust and fire sparkles. It creates a hellish picture of doomsday. I realized how fragile and insignificant our lives are in front of natural disasters. I am deeply touched when the lady says she thought she is going to die in the fire. I can feel how desperate and hopeless she was during that period of time, but I am sure what I think is way less than what she actually felt.
<br><br>
I agree that one of the major factors that caused this tragedy is the irresponsibility of the authorities and corporates. Isn’t it hilarious and pathetic that the authorities change their opinion in just a minute, from “it is just creating a lot of smoke right now” to “the entire Paradise needs to evacuate”? What really irritates and saddens me is the scene that an officer is answering a help call. The lady in the call completely expresses her hopelessness through her tone and I am 100 percent sure the officer understands that. However, the only thing he said is “we will try to send help to you”. He didn’t even ask her location and just let the phone call ends and answer another, which is highly possible that ends in a same way. I understand that it is not plausible to help everyone in such a large scale of emergency, but these actions can reflect the negligence and carelessness of the authorities in emergency. Also, if PG&E could be responsible and change its off grade power line, instead of thinking saving money by a fluke, none of these tragedies would occur. However, we can also say that everyone is responsible for this fire because we all have contributed to the rise of global temperature. If we don’t start to act now, more and bigger disasters will happen in the future.

The documentary about the country’s deadliest wildfire in over a century in the California history, the Camp Fire delivers a huge concern by showing videos and interviews from survivors and first responders. By watching people’s reactions, the Camp Fire caused tremendous effect to people’s attitude towards about the climate change. At the beginning of the documentary, the Paradise was used to be peaceful and calming which has a dramatic comparison with the Camp Fire. We could see how devastated influence that cause by the wildfire. The start of the Camp fire was minor but hardly controlled because of the dryness of the climate. By watching the documentary of the Camp Fire it was a scary experience; highway was shutting down, animals were screaming, firefighters were trying to stop the spreading of fire etc. The fire went rapid and put residents into risk. With the prolonged summertime, the climate is hotter and drier that benefit to campfire. I agreed with Michael Wara that today’s climate is a strong factor package for an explosive campfire. After the fire, 14,000 homes are destroyed, 86 people are dead and most of the rest of the population is displaced (Mutter). Paradise is no longer a heavenly place for residents. The documentary shows the consequences of climate change.

After watching “Fire in Paradise” I felt distraught about the horrors of the fire. I have never actually watched something so destructive to peoples lives and it is terrifying just how quick the lives of the people affected by the cave fire were affected. They woke up like it was just a normal morning going on with their day and in a matter of a few hours their personal belongings, loved ones, and their entire town was just gone. I had always thought that these fires started from an actual fire someone had created, but I didn’t realize that this one started from an electrical wire malfunction (one of which could have been prevented). After this faulty wire started the fire, it spread so quickly I couldn’t even fathom how much land and belongings were being destroyed by the second. This film was heart wrenching as we were able to watch first hand and follow along with the stories of people who lived through and survived this terrible fire. It is crazy to think that this type of fire happens yearly in California, and is now currently burning in other places like Australia as we speak. I hope this documentary was very eye opening to people to put into perspective how global, and terrifying climate change is.

This movie did a great job at portraying one of the many consequences of climate change. Although it doesn’t directly address climate change, watching the devastation that the fire caused helps to understand the severity that this issue is going to have. It’s a visual affirmation of all the facts and articles we’ve been reading and learning about. It also shows that climate change is here, it is no longer a future problem.
<br><br>
I remember hearing about this fire very distinctly, seeing it all over the news. I was shocked but since I lived in Los Angeles, it didn’t really affect me. However, watching this movie was horrifying and devastating. Hearing the Paradise residents share their experiences was heartbreaking. What I hadn’t realized was how quickly the fire took over and spread, completely destroying Paradise in less than half a day. As I watched the movie, I started pinpointing all the mistakes that were made along the way, getting angry and frustrated that things weren’t executed differently. I was blown away by the lack of communication between the residents of Paradise, the police and the firefighters. I couldn’t believe that some people never got mandatory evacuation orders, which cost lives, despite the fact that fire was ravaging the town. I quickly took a step back though, and realized the reason these “mistakes” were made was because no one was ready or had ever expected for such a phenomenon to occur. It was unheard of and completely unprecedented.
<br><br>
The severity and longevity of this fire is at least in part due to climate change, and as we’ve seen in recent years, these devastating fires are only going to get worse. Prolonged droughts, longer summers, hotter temperatures are all going to lead to extreme weather, including these wildfires. This movie is a testimony to how urgent of an issue the climate crisis is becoming, already affecting so many people’s lives.

I thought “Fire in Paradise” was an incredible documentary. I love Frontline’s stuff because they always manifest their stories at ground zero and build tension as the film goes on. “Fire in Paradise” was no exception.
<br><br>

I really enjoyed this film because it was more focused the impacts of here and now. With many environmental films, the danger is remote either temporally or spatially. This was not the case at all with the paradise fire as it captured the reality that climate change is in our backyards. 
<br><br>

On another note I liked that the film talked about PG&E. I think that a great deal of climate change could be mitigated if corporations were nationalized and held to a standard of worker, consumer, and environmental safety rather than capital gain. Also I think it raises the question of how we are going to hold companies accountable. Is PG&E going to get a pass for filing bankruptcy? I think that this is absurd, especially since so much damage still needs to be accounted for. Corporations enjoy playing the game of enjoying the luxuries of being treated with human rights, but of course are never there to uphold the responsibilities of their consequences. 
<br><br>

I think the film underscored how under prepared we are for climate change as well. The Paradise Fire is just one example of how easily overwhelmed people can be when a plan starts falling apart. I was shocked at how poorly prepared anyone (firemen, dispatchers, police, townspeople, etc) were to combat this fire. I think that Paradise should be a dire lesson and a warning of what is come for climate change, and a sign that we need to seriously revamp our responses to catastrophic situations that will only continue to worsen.

I disagree with your thought about nationalization. The State isn't necessarily the answer to the climate crisis, nor are corporations the evil puppeteers behind climate change. What will stop a nationalized corporation from polluting less? From emitting less CO2? You seem to equate government-controlled enterprise with ecology, which I think is a mistake. Capitalism can provide us the innovative power we need to durably combat climate change, whilst a moderately powerful state can oversee the market process to ensure environmental stability. North Korea isn't a firm but nothing stops NK from burning coal and starving its people.

After watching the documentary “Fire in Paradise”, I was interested in how the number of fires are increasing by the high increase of temperatures.  It is so depressing to watch this documentary to see how fires cause destruction, and  it is sad how fast it can be. It is also very interesting how the human caused climate change doubled within approximately thirty years. It is informing how our actions are making a negative impact on climate change and making a dramatic change within this time.The chances of rain are depreciating leading to more causes of drought and a high percentage of  causing fires. I understand how we need to prepare for future natural disasters, but we should resolve the main issue to prevent anything from occurring to be on the safer side. It is better to be safe rather than sorry. In addition, we shouldn’t put so much investment on the constructed more roads. We should put more investment on resolving the main issue of the cause and reasons why the fires are constantly coming back. The people are just wasting money on fixing things that are just going to get ruined again or possibly worse.
     <br><br>
  
I was so broken when I saw the film on how the houses that were getting burned down and sad to hear how it is only going to go downhill from here if we don’t make the change and resolution on preventing the causes of the fires and depreciating the emission of greenhouse gases. I understand that we need to prepare for these fires, but we can be ready for a fire that comes out of nowhere no matter how big or small it is. We should have to react smart and think about what to do to prevent within the situation and make better resolutions for the future.

I also found it immensely interesting but depressing watching the destruction brought by these wildfires and how frightening the speed at which they spread is. Although we should be trying to resolve the main issue by doing anything to stick to the safer side, this documentary proves that sometimes there is no amount of training, planning, or preparing that can save everything and everyone around the disaster, like mentioned in the documentary, sometimes things are just unprecedented.
     <br><br>


Towards the end, one of the speakers in the documentary stated, "We have a problem that’s going to grow worse inevitably over the next several decades." I think this ties perfectly with your comment on making better resolutions for the future. The speaker is completely right, everyday things are just getting worse and worse and there is really no way of stopping that, at least not soon, but I do believe there are ways to decrease the severity and intensity of things. One of those ways has to be coming up with as many resolutions possible to prepare for as much as possible. Obviously we cannot be ready and prepared for any and every disaster that comes across our world, but it does not hurt to try to do as much as possible to prevent or undermine as many disasters possible.

Before having this class, Climate Change is equal to global warming in my mind. Wildfire is just a natural disaster but nothing with human activities. However, Climate Change by humans actually means the continual extreme terrible weather. Many people knew the Fire in Paradise is caused by PG&E company. However, few people knew the climate change makes this fire unnormal and extremely big. In the film, it said, "10 out of 20 most destructive fires in California have happened in the last four years". California is there since the US is there. However, human activities increase the chance of big wildfires. How horrible that half of the biggest wildfires were happened in only 4 years. Look the result of what we did, the ashes were caused by our daily life's actions. Comparing the beginning and the end of the Paradise town. I was really sad that a pleasant place is disappeared and become ashes. 

     <br><br>

Besides that, I also found some problems during watching the film. When people calling 911 about confirming the fire situation, can the result be better if they gave more accurate information? I do have some complaint on Cal Fire and citizens themselves. I believe it is their responsibility that didn't check out the fire situation and gave the wrong notification to citizens. Meanwhile, those citizens were too dependent on the emergency alarm and even lost their own judgment. Like a person said in the film, they have to be responsible for their own lives.

I'm devastated. The documentary I just watched and many of you have watched as well, hit me emotionally. Throughout the video, I felt lost. The tragedy, the feared people felt during those dark days---- I cannot possibly imagine what they went through. "Fire in Paradise"showed the consequences of climate change rather than showing us how to fix or tackle such problems, which is completely different from “Before the flood.” It showed the outcomes of these devastating fires that year by year are growing and spreading faster than ever. I am confident that Ken wanted us to look at climate change from another perspective as we often look at it from the bigger picture, meaning that we only look at it from the potential disasters that could occur if we continue contaminating the world, but not at the emotional, physical or mental damage that could bring upon us.
      <br><br>

A moment that definitely struck me the most and made me cry was when the nurse got out the car and ran to embrace her husband who had thought that he had lost her. At this point, the documentary made me think of my family, of the people I love and care and what possibly could have been us at that fire. Climate crisis is knocking at our doors and we are ignoring it. It seems like climate crisis is making its way to our homes and destroying everything with it. Before the fire invaded town, the sky was clear and sunny but once the fire arrived, it seemed like darkness had engulfed the entire town of Paradise. It seemed to be something taken out of a fiction.
      <br><br>

This documentary, though short in length, has become one of my favorite documentaries because of the way it made me feel and the way it showed all the human destruction. The thought of running through fire is just impossible to conceive in my mind as it is so unreal, yet many people had to do that in order to survive. Ken mentioned that 15 of the largest wildfires in California had occurred in the 21st century, but the fires in Australia were four times as big as those fires combined. I was terrified. Just the thought of this makes me shiver and wonder how bad these incidents will become in future years if we fail to do something about it. We need to start acting now before these scenarios occur even more frequently than today until the point where it becomes a way to live or I should say, a way to survive.

Unfortunately, I was having the same feeling that you did. I was so scared, what if my home in Beijing is set on fire? The district has way more people than Paradise and God knows what would happen to my mom when the fire break out when she's at work. Me being here on the other side of the planet makes me feel useless if that happens. I also believe that we need to act upon climate crisis right now. We could all reduce our carbon footprint by eating less beef and having shorter showers. Biking is also a great way to reduce your carbon footprint, you even get healthier doing it.
      <br><br>

The fire in Australia also terrifies me. I can't believe that that amount of forest is on fire. Imagine how many years would it take for the forest to grow back. Let alone the aminals that got killed in the fire, they lost their habitat. The whole food chain is missing the bottom part, which would eventually lead to a collapse in the ecosystem in the area of the fire. I really hope for the fire to stop soon, no further damage is needed.

<br><hr>

I defenitely agree with your emotional response to this documentary. This 40-minute long documentary is a compelling piece of art that leaves me wanting for more. While watching the film, my heart was crushed by the videos of people who are preparing for their death and making their last phone calls to their loved ones. A police officer described forcing a man to leave his dog behind and that made me think about my dog and his safety. If my dog dies because of climate change, I took part in the murder and that would be sad. Two teachers recollect a dangerous situation of being on a bus full of schoolchildren, stuck in traffic. The kids began getting sleepy, experiencing the first symptoms of smoke inhalation. These scenes made me think of the inevitability of when climate change is going to punish me for all the carbon dioxide I have emitted to the atmosphere.

At the end of the video, professor Ken mentions the fire in Australia now. Australia has been ravaged by some of the worst wildfires seen in decades, with the massive blazes destroying homes, devastating wildlife, turning skies blood-red and leaving many people dead nationwide. The fire is so big that it burns for four months though the government tried many ways to solve it. The documentary “ Fire in Paradise” also describes the seriousness of forest fire and people’s helplessness under such unpredictable disasters. What impressed me most in the movie is that when forest fire closed to the local hospital, all the patients needed to move out. However, the fire was so serious and suddenly burned everything surrounding the hospital. I remember that a nurse was helpless when she saw her car was on fire. At that time, I felt helpless under the situation too. When they finally found the source, it was powered by a small piece of equipment dropped from a high voltage tower by PG&E. They also found most electricity towers of the company are outdated. A tiny part of equipment caused a spreading fire and many people died. 
      <br><br>

Although this documentary did not show the issue of climate change directly, it still shocked me in some ways.



</p><hr>



<p>
My first response to “Fire in Paradise” is wow, these fires are now a common occurrence. My mind goes back to English 22 when Ken taught that back when the King George Bible was translated the authors added in the “fire and brimstone” line to make hell seem especially awful to Londeners, who already knew that the “brimstone” (coal) was what was causing the city’s terrible smog and acid rain. It seems poetic in a way that people’s greed (that being a cardinal sin) has led them to performing the very action that is now turning the Earth into their very own definition of what hell would be.
      <br><br>

I am honestly terrified of the Camp Fire. Upon reflection, I feel like I could have easily been one of those people who underestimated the fire and didn’t want to leave the house. The emergency services in Paradise were so woefully underprepared to be able to deal with a fire of such magnitude. Not even the emergency alert system was properly set up so half the population didn’t even receive an evacuation alert. I can’t help but notice that every part of this disaster was caused by people. Climate change caused the perfect dry weather to make kindling for the fire. PG&E provided the spark. Even the town of Paradise that the fire burned down was built by people, that being slightly more inentional than the other factors. As a species, it is imperative that we start to pay more attention to the side effects of our actions.

I find the fire and brimstone to be a perfect comparison to the fire.  PG&E’s mistakes, combined with the effects of climate change, had created hell on Earth.  I never thought about how terrifying fire is in person until I watched this documentary.  The first person videos showed places completely surrounded by walls of fire.  People were panicking and being suffocated by the smoke.  I’m sure in many people’s minds, hell looks like this.  I agree that every part of this disaster was caused by people.  That is why we have to slow down climate change, or else other places will continue to be vulnerable to incidents such as this one.

The climate crisis first sparked public imagination in the second half of the 20th century, and we usually call it global warming and see these potential consequences. In other words, the biggest concern is sea level rise, because nearly half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, and sea level rise is a huge problem. Like most people, I used to think that sea-level rise was still far away from us, and those articles about climate change were more alarmist. Thought we were far away from those disasters. In fact, those disasters are already before us. as the professor said in this video, those disasters will come far faster than we imagine and hit closer to our home , regardless of where our home is on the planet. When disaster strikes, no one is immune. 

      <br><br>

Because we pay less attention to the environment (we pay more attention to political achievements), politicians also pay less attention to the environment than political achievements. In other words, we care more about money, benefits (short-term benefits). But things are different now, the previous generation may not be responsible for their actions and we are responsible for their actions and our actions.

What I really liked about the documentary “Fire in Paradise” was revealing it was on how big the fire was and on how frightened people were. Even though it did not talk much about climate change, I really learned a lot from wildfires. Before watching his film, I would have never thought that a fire could cause such a huge damage or that it would spread so far and quick. It was so sad to watch the little girl cry about how scared she was and how she lost an important person. I started to think how I would feel if that was me. Ofcourse then I said that it will be me if I don’t do something about it.
      <br><br>
What I also learned from this documentary is that there should be more preparedness. As shown in the film, people were not informed that they were in danger until the fire had finally reached their homes. Information should be gathered more efficiently so that people can have time to grab their valuable belongings leave knowing that they can make it out. With no time, getting out of a fire is rough, like in the video, the roads were clogged with cars full of people trying to leave. 
      <br><br>
This film really enhanced my thinking towards the climate crisis in the sense that climate change is the main cause of these disasters

“Fire in Paradise” gave me a detailed inside look at what hell on earth really looks like. The scenes from within the bowels of the fire are truly frightening. It’s hard to imagine that fires like that exist, let alone exist so close to home. With climate change being the single biggest threat to humanity, we need to work together to significantly reduce our carbon footprint. If we don’t, fires like the one in Paradise, as well as other natural disasters will not only continue, but they will worsen and become more deadly over time. 
<br><br>
I agree that it was very sad to see the child cry and in fear. Situations like the Paradise fire would bring anyone to tears, but a child in particular should be protected at all costs, and it is truly devastating to see the effects of climate change harming our planet’s children. The Boomer generation has left us, and our children, and their great-grandchildren’s grandchildren a world that is becoming evermore uninhabitable, and that is completely despicable.


<br><hr>
This film helps bring light to the idea of how people must react when times of disaster strikes. In areas that are prone to wildfire cautionary procedures should be trained to the residents. I believe this could help fight against the severity of fire on human life.


<br><hr>

Extreme weather events and natural disasters are a direct symptom of climate change. The extremities of California wildfires, such as the Paradise Fire (Camp Fire) have continued to worsen in recent years as longer fire seasons, droughts, strong winds, and rising temperatures that have been experienced across both northern and southern California. In my own hometown, Corona, CA, the 2018 Holy Fire burned 23,136 acres. Thankfully, my town didn’t face nearly as much devastation as Paradise, although, the capabilities of a raging wildfire as displayed in the documentary and seen through my own experiences have definitely heightened my fear of what extreme weather events and natural disasters are capable of with the exacerbated effects of climate change. 
      <br><br>


From local fires such as the Camp Fire to international cases of wildfires in Australia or the Amazon Rainforest, fires continue to gather an increasing amount of media attention and funding to fight and deal with their aftermath. This very same money should be funneled into prevention to avoid massive fires and improve safety in the first place. I do recognize that being prepared for a spreading fire isn't anything like getting ready for a hurricane, tornado, or blizzard. There often aren’t weeks or days to prepare as fires can spread quickly jumping over streets, highways, and engulfing entire buildings. As shown in the documentary, the Camp Fire spread so quickly, many were unable to fully evacuate, Code Red systems weren’t used, and poor infrastructure made escaping difficult. 
      <br><br>


Overall, it’s unfortunate that we’re left to cope with these disasters and the losses that come with them. However, I believe that it’s important to recognize that they’re a direct reflection of the harm we’re inducing on our climate. We shouldn't simply resort to building more roads to make escape easier or reconstructing buildings in the same fire-prone areas. Only tackling the root cause of wildfires by mitigating climate change can truly halt its effects.

The film “Fire in Paradise” demonstrates how the increasing temperatures of the Earth will become even more dangerous. Although the fire was due to the breakage of a PG&E power line, the prolonged droughts and winds made it much worse. Just recently, there was a fire near Santa Barbara. More people should be concerned about climate change especially since California fires have been becoming more frequent. Over time, these fires will be more destructive and harder to control. The film showed how destructive fires can be, and it was really heartbreaking to see how many people lost their homes and family members. I could not imagine the fear the people must have felt to be completely surrounded by fire and having no way out. “Fire in Paradise” also reveals how big corporations and companies are being irresponsible with our environment. As mentioned in the film, if they were people and not big corporations, they would be in jail. These corporations should be taking more responsibility in helping restore our Earth not just people making individual changes.

The film “Fire in Paradise” astounded me. I was not aware that this had happened (I should have been), and it was absolutely heartbreaking to watch. I agree with you that big corporations like PG&E should be more conscious about the decisions that they make and how it heavily affects people. People did not see that the climate crisis that we are currently in can affect anyone. It’s crazy that this can make a small fire turn into one that can destroy a whole town. The fires that we have seen in the news are horrendous to watch and we should do something about it. We can’t just keep sitting here and wait for things to get better themselves. 
       <br><br>
The fires that have also been going on in Australia and how its four times worse the fires we have here is frightening to hear. The lives and homes lost to these fires hurts so many people. “Fire in Paradise” shows how quickly a fire can cause so much damage in a matter of hours. I hope that this shows people that climate change creates much more than just sea level rise. The fires going on around the world prove that we have to start changing our ways because, if we don’t, cities will start to burn down.

The tragedy experienced in Paradise continues to reinforce the wealth of evidence that the climate crisis is real, effects all, and can not be treated like an abscess for the poor, third world countries. Indifference and complacency of people in positions that cannot afford to have such attitudes brings us to where we are today. Accountability of our nation's businesses and corporations is one of my primary concerns as it, or rather the lack thereof, is responsible for many injustices against civilization. The PG&E company embody the attitude that has brought us to this critical point in history. The panic and emotional trauma incurred by the residents of Paradise alone greatly outweigh the profit for not replacing the expired electrical towers and allowing operation in spite of the dangerously high winds.
       <br><br>

While one fire and one incident isn't enough to claim the notion of climate change, the statistics certainly can. Watching "Fire in Paradise" has helped me further realize that one day I too will experience the vengeance of our abused ecosystem. Too many of us are plagued with the belief that what has happened to others couldn't happen to us.

Given that we’re no longer in the “prevention phase” and getting dangerously near the end of the “mitigation phase”, I do wonder what things we can do to reduce fires. Unless carbon capture happens to significantly decrease the amount of Co2 in the atmosphere, we need to realize that reducing our current emissions will, at best, keep our temperature where it is right now.  Without any increase in Co2 emissions we will still be facing fires at the rate we are witnessing right now. For this reason, I’m curious how we can help prevent these catastrophes. I think our government needs to prioritize solving these issues as best we can considering how absolutely devastating these events are. There are very few things in this world more frightening than being in a fire, and it always seemed as if it was so awful that it could never happen to me. However, the possibility of it happening to me is becoming increasingly real. It's scary that multiple times in recent memory it seems like the entire state was on fire. Even further, some of my good friends from middle school moved to Australia and described the situation as “apocalyptic”. It's so easy to get desensitized from all this bad news and stop really caring, but it's films like this that really remind you how absolutely horrifying these events can be. I’ve read countless articles about the Australia fires and even had my friends tell me how scary they are, yet, I never truly understood the effect until the documentary showed the clip of the 9/11 operator on the phone with that woman in the burning house. I’m not kidding when I say I donated to the Australian fire relief effort within minutes of watching the documentary. I truly believe that no human with a conscience can watch that clip and not feel the need to help. And furthermore, I cannot comprehend how selfish our society has become with regards to this issue. Jeff Bezos was praised for donating 1 million dollars to Australia’s relief fund. Really think about that. Jeff Bezos the BILLIONAIRE could only spare one million dollars to help people who are literally having their entire livelihoods uprooted? I don’t want to shame anyone for contributing because it could discourage them from doing so in the future, but are we really supposed to accept that Jeff Bezos chose to keep his money so he could spend it on yachts, cars, and houses rather than help thousands of people who just fled their homes from a fire? That money could go towards rebuilding homes, new equipment for firefighters, for god sakes he could pay for rescue helicopters. But instead, in his mind, it was more worthwhile to buy his 11th house on some island.

I agree with you that the increasing number of fires is very concerning, especially seeing a city that had detailed plans for evacuation being so unprepared and taken aback from this fire. Also, I agree that these billionaires should be helping people out more than they do. Even though Jeff Bezos committed 2 billion dollars to charity in late 2018, that 2 billion only makes up 1.7% of his net worth. That's just sad honestly, and there are many many rich people you could find that have a similar behaviors.

The only emotion I felt when watching the documentary was anger: there were so many things that the 911 dispatchers could’ve done, there were so many options for the fire department to do such as call for an evacuation, there were so many opportunities for the whole town to have a system or two that could reach each individual especially if there were a lot of elders. The interviewees and narrator had admitted several times that there were options and opportunities. The fires being as big as it was was a climate crisis issue, however, the fires in Paradise especially were more than a climate issue: it was a humanity issue. PG&E was definitely the perpetrators of the fires but they did not face any consequence following the fire in Paradise. The documentary mentioned that if PG&E were an individual, they would receive a federal consequence for harming a whole entire city and killing 85 people. But since PG&E is a large corporation that is responsible for power in Northern California, it did not serve the consequences that it deserved. Money and greed really was the power that overshadowed the death of 85 people. 
       <br><br>

 The documentary was really effective in terms of pathos: the different interviews and stories between the R.N. of the local hospital, the woman who lost her mother, and the woman who lost her grandfather really drew me in as an audience because this fire affected not just the whole entire town, but also the people of the town who had to evacuate. Even though the documentary was not focused on the climate crisis, we as students of the Climate Crisis 101 can definitely figure out the cause of the spread of the fire: high winds caused by hot temperatures from climate change. Climate change somehow will always be a leading cause of any natural disaster as can be seen with the fire in Paradise; the power line sparked the fire but the high winds and hot temperatures fueled it to grow and devour an entire town.

It is a shame that so many people lost their lives, loved ones, or property. I feel the same way as you do, there could have been so much improvements to the towns’ system that would have prevented so many deaths, but in contrast, because the county wanted to save money, they allowed such catastrophe to happen. There are a lot of factors to blame here, but like you said, PG&E is main cause of this problem, everyone could see it, but due to their superiority over the average citizens, they escaped the blame. I believe we should stand together against these large corporates violating the regulations to prevent further harms.


<br><hr>

I definitely agree that anger was the most prominent emotion that I felt after watching “Fire in Paradise”. There was so much that could have been done for the people in Paradise. Although, I am sure the fire department did what they believed was the best the could do, they should have done so much more early on. They should have informed the residents sooner, they should have made sure that every house in Paradise knew that the evacuation of was absolutely mandatory. It hurts to think that someone’s life could have been saved if they had known to evacuate. The fact that PG&E plays such a big role in wildfires across California was not surprising, however I do wish they were held accountable for their actions. 

       <br><br>

The stories of each individual were also greatly moving. The fact that the woman abandoned in the middle of the road could not do much except wait for help was terrifying. However, I wish that along with personal stories the documentary had focused more on the climate change aspect of wildfires.


<br><hr>

It's interesting to see how you begun with the phrase that "there were so many things that X could've done." To an extent there is so many things that we all could have done, but what i believe what matters to many people is what happens after the situation escalates. This seems to be especially true with those large corporations that leak oil into our oceans or like PG&E's negligence to preventing the fires caused by their own equipment (or at least admitting their part in the situation and doing more things to prevent it). Climate is like the human body. The things we put into it can cause it to get sick or worse, become cancerous. The more we invest into it with healthy practices, changes in lifestyle and what we consume, will become a remedy far stronger that simply taking medication after it gets sick.
<br><hr>
The part where they mentioned that if PG&E were an individual and not a corporation they would be arrested also caught my attention. It’s especially strange because the U.S. gives corporations so many rights, they are able to act as an individual and take advantage of loopholes to get out of things like taxes. But when it comes to penalties, the U.S. disregards this and treats corporations as not just a business, but an entity that cannot be regulated or policed in the same way a citizen would. Like you said, money and greed was the cause of these deaths.
        <br><br>
In a broader sense, money and greed is the reason for pretty much every harmful environmental disaster that affects people all over the world. Politicians have power over the fate of the entire world, and with lobbyists having such a large role in the political world, corporate interests are really the source of most policymaking. When motivated by money and greed, companies are able to cause devastation in the form of climate change and disasters like the Paradise Fire. While not explicitly blaming climate change, this documentary brings light to the unjust amount of agency that companies have allowing them to destroy the environment and consequently the lives of the people in it.

<br><hr>
I absolutely agree with the emotion you felt as well as with the way you believed the film was effective. Firstly, I too felt extreme anger towards police and 911 dispatchers, due to the fact that they decided not to use their new "code red" alert system to notify the public that the fire was much more destructive than anyone thought it would be. Additionally, I felt a sense of despair for the people who lived within Paradise and neighboring towns. they lost everything, ranging from their own homes and personal wealth to public necessities such as hospitals. I couldn't and still am unable to wrap my mind around how these people will be able to regain their livelihood, but what shocked me the most is that despite how upset they were about the circumstance, every survivor was just thankful to be alive.
        <br><br>


The use of interviews from all sides of the story had a huge emotional impact. Using stories from all aspects of life, whether it be the nurses and staff evacuating the hospital, the firefighters going back in to attempt to save lives, or the 911 operators answering extremely heartbreaking calls for help made me realize how even though the authorities should have acted sooner in response to original warning signs, the main problem is our degradation of the environment. Hopefully, for our sake of living in California in the future, we can spend money to help prevent occurrences like this from happening rather than having to use the money to rebuild, as will have to be done to the town of Paradise.

<br><hr>
The film also made me angry about how preventable it was. Mostly at PG&E for their gross negligence. At the beginning of the film it mentions that  they considered cutting power in order to avoid a fire, but decided not to. Their greater interest in profit than safety lead to mass destruction and 85 deaths. Later it mentioned PG&E's equipment being very old and in need of replacement. Their failure to replace old hardware is another example of the company valuing money over the safety of our state. 
        <br><br>


On top of PG&Es gross misconduct, there were so many other missed opportunities to save lives. It seemed like everyone was way to casual about the situation until it was far too late. The strong winds alone should have been a terrifying wake up call for preparative action. People were simply in denial of the hazard they were facing

        <br><br>

Like the articles from this week and last, this movie demonstrated how serious and eminent the climate crisis is. Because of an increase in climate and the drought, fires like this are becoming more and more common. The movie shows a real consequence of our actions, and shows how selfish actions by individuals can destroy our planet.
<br><hr>
Upon watching “Paradise on Fire, ”I also felt much anger. A lot of it was felt towards the negligence that PG&E had exhibited that caused the fire. As you mentioned that the documentary, if PG&E was a single person instead of a corporation, there would have been a person in jail for the Paradise fire. Though I do agree with this, I feel like I agree with this to an extent because of the amount of accountability that corporations are not pressured with, particularly the state and its laws. I feel that the man should have stated that had PG&E have not been a multibillion dollar company, it would have not gotten away with the cause of the Paradise fire. I say this because this is a repeated pattern in multibillion /multimillion dollar corporations, who do in fact have a face behind the company. Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of the world’s carbon emissions. Corporations are able to get away with this because of wealth and the way it is able to control many assets of society. For example, corporations hire scientists to deny climate change, corporations largely fund climate change denying politicians, and finally, corporations are able to buy natural resources and land to build infrastructure and extract resources carelessly.  I believe that had there been stricter laws for corporations, PG&E would have not gotten away with having transmission towers that averaged older than the life expectancy of transmission towers. 
        <br><br>

 I also agree that the documentary was really effective in terms of pathos, and what makes it more concerning is that many of these people had no idea the severity of the fire to begin with. I believe that their response to the fire would be similar to many of us who would experience a natural disaster. For example, the Thomas Fire in 2017 was not taken seriously, not were the mudslides that followed. For example, not even the chancellor of our school did not cancel classes immediately, as the fires essentially “posed no threat to campus”. I think that positions of authority should consider the severity and the impact of climate change on individuals since such disasters can happen anywhere and to anyone. They should be responsible as it is extremely difficult to follow emergency protocol and thus should be taken seriously, since it is likely not everything will go according to plan.

<br><hr>

Like you too, the main emotion I felt while watching this documentary was anger. Anger at PG&E, for their gross misconduct and how unapologetic they were. If they turned off the power, which they should have, there would have been no fire, however they deemed the high winds as not high enough, and as a result, caused one of the most deadliest fires of California.
        <br><br>

I also did not appreciate how long it took for an evacuation for the whole town to be called, many people could have escaped earlier and casualties would have been less if the evacuation was called earlier. Many of the people of Paradise did not receive the evacuation order too, because they decided to alert people using a feature that alerts only if they signed up for it. The people of Paradise were left in the dark about the whereabouts of the fire, and when the evacuation was called, it was too late.

        <br><br>

PG&E is partly responsible for the fire, however we too are responsible too. As a result of climate change, there are a lot more prolonged droughts, and with the increase in temperature, the wildfire season has been getting longer and longer.
        <br><br>


My heart goes for the people who lost their homes and families to the fire. We must start treating climate change seriously, otherwise we are going to see many more fires like this and also other natural disasters happening.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that corporate greed is the real culprit of the damages of the fire. It seems to be a recurring theme in climate change as well as in our society overall. The documentary also caused me to reconsider the massive financial consequences to climate change. Very interesting film.

<br><hr>

I can not imagine how horrible that must have been for the people of Paradise, having gone through such a traumatic experience. I can not believe that the PG&E got off so easily, people dies because of their recklessness and lack of safety measure. They did not face major consequences just because they are a big corporation and I think that is just shocking. Hearing the victims of the fires speak about their experience added an emotional factor that people need to see so they can understand what really is at stake and the need to do something.

<br><hr>

After watching this film I feel very similar to you. Worrisome, angry, sadness, all at once. Worried because this may happen to anyone of us in the near future with the current state of wildfires in California. Sadness for all of those whose families were lost, and the communities that were destroyed. And anger for those who have the power to make the change and let it get to this point did nothing to stop it. It is selfish and outrageous that there are people out there who prioritize the money they will make(for personal gain) over the lives of many.
<br><hr>

I also felt angry with the way the fire was handled and the legal actions that weren't taken. It is extremely saddening that people have suffered through tragedies such as this and have lost their homes, possessions, and in some cases their life. The fact that a company was responsible for the fire but had no punishment is outrageous. The people in Paradise suffered because of a lack of preparation for what was to come, and now that the temperature is continuing to rise we need to make sure that more places are prepared for disasters like this. With climate change growing, fires like the one in paradise can sprout up and devastate entire cities with ease. Fires are starting to become a regular occurence and they're getting worse and worse as time progresses.
<br><hr>

I definitely agree that one of the most prominent emotions I felt while watching this film was anger. To be frank, I cried on and off the whole time. I am filled with anger and frustration at the shockingly cavalier manner in which many of the state fire officials initially addressed and planned for a situation such as the Camp Fire. I think a large part of this negligence stems not from incompetence, but from a genuine lack of knowledge as to the probable severity of climate related catastrophes in the present day. It should be common knowledge by now, particularly to those individuals within the fire, police, emergency, and electrical service crews such as PG&E, that California is in what seems to be a fairly permanent and ever worsening drought, accompanied in recent years by a year long fire season, strong gusty winds, and quickly aging and faulty power line equipment. 
        <br><br>


It was found that PG&E alone was responsible for no fewer than 1,500 fires in the last 6 years in California. Billions of dollars in damages, hundreds of lives, and entire communities and ecosystems have been destroyed because of the gross negligence of this company. But to blame the severity of the Camp Fire on PG&E completely overlooks the influence of our rapidly changing climate. Twenty years ago, when we were all babies, these types of catastrophic fires were not the norm for California. Fires were a summer problem and could be put out with relatively minimal damage. Those days are now long gone. 
        <br><br>


When we consider the relative importance of climate change to the generation of people who are currently serving as firemen, policemen, and at our power companies, we can begin to see why their plans for disaster are not designed to function in the type of fast moving, large scale disasters that we are currently facing. They are designed for a world largely absent of climate related disaster; one where fires move slowly and predictably, not 80 football fields a minute in all directions. Until we start demanding action of these officials and calling for reform within these institutions, we cannot hope for plans accurately equipped to deal with the fast approaching disasters that are on a scale which we have not yet seen.
<br><hr>
Yeah, true. I feel exactly the same as you do. They can do much more than what they are doing now, but they just do not have the spirit to work on that.
<br><hr>

While I do agree that this problem could have been prevented, the same could be said for a lot of things in the world. In hindsight, we could fix a lot of things about our planet but that simply isn't the case. I believe the dispatchers, firefighters, etc did what they could under seemingly unforeseen circumstances. Sure, there were many instances of mistakes and miscommunication, but that is only natural in such a high-pressure situation. That is why I believe we should instead allocate our attention to the bigger picture of climate change and now taking preventative measures into ensuring a similar event will not happen again. Just to clarify, I am in no way justifying the actions of PG&E. There are many greedy companies in the world that only make this fight harder for us and the rest of humanity.
<br><hr>
I have to say, I strongly disagree with your opening sentence. What more could they have done? Warned more people, yeah. And then what? With one road out of Paradise, and thousands of people rushing to get out, the traffic was horrendous. Not to mention the literal FIRE on the road ahead. Even if the city had planned for such a quick spreading fire, there is not much more they could have done. The events all took place within HOURS. People became trapped in their homes within hours of the start of the fire, and while I do agree that there should have been more efforts already in place for warning people and beginning evacuations, I honestly do not think that there would have been a big difference in the amount of casualties. The fire spread so quickly that there was realistically NOT ENOUGH TIME to evacuate everyone safely. 
        <br><br>

I began watching “Fire in Paradise” in a good mood, not expecting to be very shocked as I already felt quite immersed in the reality of the drastic effects that climate change is causing. However, the film brought me to tears numerous times in the span of less than an hour. The footage of embers spewing in every direction, people being evacuated straight out of surgery, houses being eaten by flames... was really unsettling. One of the 911 calls where the woman was stuck in her home, surrounded by flames, BEGGING for help, was heartbreaking. The entire episode put a whole new spin on the situation, showed me things I had never been able to completely comprehend, and just made me all the more aware to our dark future. The fact that human caused climate change has doubled wild fires since 1984-compared to how often they would occur without climate change- is not really surprising, but it is saddening. We need to GET ON THIS ISSUE, and FAST.
<br><hr>

Your keen observation that the fires in Paradise "were more than a climate issue", they were "a humanity issue", is a painfully accurate observation that acts as a detail that applies to the bigger picture of climate change itself. Just as the fires in Paradise were the result of the gross negligence and greed of a large corporation, so to is the climate crisis a result of the gross negligence of dozens of large corporations that fail to deal with their own environmental impacts. Sure, it is nice and marginally helpful to convince the public that they must pull back their individual carbon footprint in order to preserve the climate, but in the end what must be done is to target the real perpetrators of the large majority of the damage done to the climate: the large corporations that use and abuse the Earth's natural resources and pump hundreds upon thousands of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. Just as PG&E got away with negligible consequences despite the horrific harm they caused to those around, so too are today's largest corporations getting away with exploiting our climate for the benefit of the company. The fires in Paradise thus serves as not only a cautionary tale of the local devastating effects of climate change, but also as a small portrait echoing the issues of the bigger picture of climate change: the issues on the local level are echoed on the global scale.
<br><hr>
I agree that this documentary was very upsetting; however I do not think the firefighters and first responders can be blamed for the way they reacted. It was said in the beginning of the film that typically there is time to assess the fire and alert the people through people on the scene and from the air. The only reason that this was difficult was because the first responders had to immediately star saving people once they were on the scene and they had no air support because of the high winds. I do not think it is fair to hold it against the fire fighters that they were too busy saving people and did not have extra help because of winds caused by climate change. 
        <br><br>

What upsets me is that there really was not that much that could be done to lessen the effects of this fire. It was spreading unprecedentedly fast and no matter how hard the firefighters worked to save people and how quickly those in the hospital evacuated, the devastation was unavoidable. It is very terrifying that in some natural disasters, it is really impossible to fully prepare and that the climate crisis is constantly increasing the likelihood of these disasters.
        <br><br>

A couple years ago, in Orange County, where I live, we had a fairly large fire. An evacuation warning was sent out while I was home alone and I had to pack up our valuables by myself while my parents were stuck in the traffic of people trying to evacuate. Luckily, the fire did not reach my house, but it did burn much of the canyon that I grew up running in. I understood the people in the film who did not see the seriousness of the fire until it was already very close because even after I got the evacuation warning, I felt that I would be fine and that the fire was still far enough away not to worry. If this fire had been moving as quickly as the Camp Fire then I would have been very ill prepared because of my false sense of confidence that I had experienced plenty of fires growing up in California and did not have to stress about it.
        <br><br>

Also, it is pretty unbelievable that PG&E is able to get away with so much because of the power of their corporation and that they knowingly refused to turn off power in order to make more money. The film mentions that now they are trying to change their ways and turn off power on high risk days, but obviously they are not doing this because they actually care about people's safety. Their main reason behind it is because they cannot be liable anymore due to how much they owe in damages for what they have caused; it all comes back to them continuing to want to make money and save themselves.

I remember stepping out of my third-period class into a hazy, smoke-filled sky, surprised that the usually prominent clock tower at the center of campus was obscured by a cloud of smog. It was hard to breathe, and I could feel the dust particles in my throat and chest as I inhaled. 
        <br><br>


It wasn’t the first day the air in San Jose had been polluted by the Paradise Fires, but it was the day that made me realize how severe the fires really were. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but while my peers were complaining about air quality, the people of Paradise were watching their home be swallowed by a fire moving at the speed of 80 football fields per minute. That's incredibly frightening to think about. 

        <br><br>

After watching “Fire in Paradise,” I realized that there were so many problems with the disaster that struck the unfortunate town in Butte County. At first, I was a little confused as to what the Paradise Fires had to do with climate change, because it seemed clear to me that the main problems were the lack of proper communication and the irresponsibility of PG&E for not acting on faulty power lines. But when the documentary illustrated the weather conditions that caused the equipment to fall and set the brush on fire, I understood why Ken chose this film. The climate is getting warmer, drier, and windier, which is the perfect condition for fires. I only hope that the fires in Paradise taught the world a lesson and that the homes and individuals lost made it clear that climate change is a crucial issue. A fire could pop up at any moment, and that's just one of countless disasters that could strike because insufficient action has been taken to combat climate change.

I also felt confusion about why we were supposed to watch this movie for a class on climate change. I realized that this documentary really helps highlight one aspect of climate change that makes it so much more frightening and devastating. The unpredictability of it. There are many facets to how we are destroying the Earth, from fracking to CO2 pollution, and an excessive dependence on livestock. It only makes sense that the issues we face as a result are also multiplied. I fear that, just as it is difficult to see how climate change worsens these fires and other natural disasters, there will be many other hidden effects that will suddenly become apparent.


<br><hr>

I understand your desire for the world to learn from this tragic disaster but we haven't or at least the world hasn't at all. The massive wildfires occurring in Australia are somehow being lost in main media because the media chooses to report about the latest Hollywood scandal or the new Ticktock start. We are currently failing to address the disaster happening at the moment because we don't inform the people of what is happening. The same situation we are as of right now, the people of the Butte County were also on that day of November 8th, 2018. They were not aware of what was happening around them because everyone failed to inform them. We are failing right now as we were two years ago. Not much has changed. Unfortunately.

Watching the film "Fire in Paradise" defeated my expectations of what I was going to read. At some points during the documentary I had a very bad feeling in my gut for the horror that I was witnessing in the footage that was shown during it. I understand that Hiltner was having us watch this movie because climate change and how it is occurring in our lifetime regardless if we want to believe it is or not. This film was very moving and made me question other big companies like that of PG&E and how they are hurting the people they are supposed to be working for. I think that it is very important that everyone has a plan to deal with unnatural natural events like the vicious fire that tore Paradise apart. As much as people want to trust the authorities to take care of us, at the end of the day it is up to us, the general public, to be prepared for the worst because this film even showed itself that the authorities that we look up to can be unprepared as well. As heartbreaking as the film is, it is a good chance of pace from the numbers and facts that are told objectively to us of why we should be worried about climate change.

I agree with your statements. I think people have to be more aware of situations and have a sense of understanding what is going on. In the film many people called to ask about the fires and although that is the right thing to do, I think they still should have noticed that they should have evacuated sooner due to the poor air quality. Although, I do believe many people did that anyway, there probably should have been more. 

        <br><br>

This film covered several topics but the one that really got to me was the fact that the residents were being fed the wrong information because the initial dispatchers did not recognize the severity of the situation. People never think something will happen to them until it happens to them and that is where I wish people were more aware. Following that, the moment the situation got worse, the people who were set to be notified were the ones that were subscribed to the newsletters (and even those people were not ). In my opinion, pulling off that stunt put many people in danger. Had everyone known earlier, more people would still be alive, had all people just been notified, more people would still be alive. 
        <br><br>


For the longest time California was deep in a drought and at that point, corporations should have known what could happen with a single spark in their electrical system. 
        <br><br>


Not everyone is ready for disaster and chaos but they should be and it is sad that is has to be this way.

I am from Chico, which is just a short, 20 min drive from Paradise, where my dad teaches at the middle school. I remember November 8th so clearly and have a feeling I always will. I could write hundreds of words about the emotions and memories I have from that day because it was so strange and unfamiliar. It was unlike anything I had ever seen and felt. My heart and stomach was so heavy with worry, stress and fear that I couldn’t think straight. This is climate change. This is people’s lives. This is real. This is now and this is the future if something doesn’t change. Something this bad should not need to happen in order for people to wake up and see how badly we are hurting our planet and how badly it is affecting real human lives. People have had to recreate their entire lives and just start over because of this fire. I hadn’t seen this film, just because I was afraid of what I would feel while and after watching it. What I feel is different than I expected. I feel a desire to become more active and educated in order to do what I possibly can to help our planet and the people that live on it. 
         <br><br>
While this was a really depressing and hard time for the people of Paradise and Chico, it was also amazing to see just how strong and supportive the town of Chico could be. In the face of disaster, we were able to come together and help our neighbors. Multiple shelters were opened up, World Central Kitchen prepared and served meals everyday, an overwhelming amount of clothing donations were given to donation sites everywhere, and my high school teamed up with the other high school to put on a clothes drive for students our age who lost their homes and things in the fire. 
         <br><br>
This strength in community needs to happen all around the world and right now, before things get any worse. Seeing how strong and supportive a small town like Chico can be gives me hope for the strength of the entire global population. We need to use this strength to make things happen so that the state of our planet and the places we live aren’t harmed any further.

After watching the documentary "Fire in Paradise", we can easily acknowledge the fact that the wildfires which cause great harms to the people are caused by the longer, hotter and drier summer. And, no doubt, the hotter summers are caused by the global warming and carbon emissions. Climate Scientist Gonzalez said in the documentary that “human-caused climate change has doubled wildfire since 1984”, which should make us alert what climate changes are causing. Rising temperatures lead to the prolonged no-rain season, the less moist atmosphere, and the dry-bone trees, which work as the perfect fuels for the fire. 
         <br><br>


In addition, although a little digressive, I have to say that I was quite moved when I saw the evacuation of the hospital, everyone is trying, trying to get more people out, even if it was in such a hurry and chaos. They used all the vehicles, they even took out their car seats to save their patients, neighbors and friends. And, also the firefighters, in a Chinese saying, firefighters are called “The most beautiful retrogrades”. Since, when everyone is running out, they are running into the fire to check the situation and save more people’s lives. Really appreciated and I am so grateful to the people who devote themselves to help others. 

         <br><br>

The documentary is informative and effective, since it contains so many radio clips, interviews and the real recordings of the situations of Paradise to let us see what really happened and how horrible it was.

I agree with you when you were saying how the evacuation of the hospital was very moving. It was a very chaotic scene that made me not only very appreciative of everyone's efforts, but also extremely frustrated that situations like this occur yet there are still climate change deniers. The fact that the community came together in their best efforts for the safety of everyone truly shows the better side of humanity, and also reveals how if we really wish to make a change, we have the ability to put in time and resources to make that change. However, the fact that it had to come to this disaster before any action was taken, was a little disheartening. Many lives were lost due to indirect causes of climate change, yet some still have the audacity to call climate change fake. The mere act of calling climate change fake is just disrespectful to those who lost their lives in the fires or died trying to help others. The firefighters and others who lost their lives were true heroes, and I wish that no one else has to go through this due to these unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change.

After watching the documentary “Fire in Paradise”, my heart was deeply wrenched in pain and sorrow for the people who had to suffer from this disaster and for the many lives that were unfortunately lost during this event. The film even became so painful for me to watch at one point that I just had to pause for a moment to regather myself before diving in again into the scenes of roads and communities burning fully on fire. I remember seeing the news about this fire on TV a couple of years ago, and I knew that the consequences of a fire this enormous in scale and destructive would be terrifying, but I never really imagined how the residents in the area were negatively impacted by this fire and how big of a toll this fire had taken on the towns of Paradise and Concow. There were so many memorable moments during the documentary that were absolutely appalling to even witness, and appalling is not even a word that is strong enough for what was actually happening on that day, November 8th, 2018, from the fire. 
         <br><br>

The video clip of the two sides of a road in Paradise completely engulfed by fire and burning embers of fire were visible everywhere in sight, while there were still cars and people stuck on the road because of traffic and could not get out of the town to safety, had completely and will forever be forged in my mind that I will never forget how frightening that scene was, how scared and fearful the people who were stuck in their cars on the road was as they were watching the fire gradually approaching them. 
         <br><br>

The story of the nurse working in the Paradise hospital who almost thought would lose her life in the fire had really touched me and I was so moved by her story that I could imagine how hopeless and dreadful she was facing the fire advancing towards her car that she had to get out of the car and literally run through fire bearing the extreme heat until she found a fire truck. I could hear the torment and agony in her voice when she was calling her husband almost in the tone of saying a farewell that she might actually die in the fire and that she was so sorry and that she loved him and her family so much, and I just could not help but feel this pain in my heart as well as if I were in the situation with her. Finally when she reunited with her family and her husband said that he thought he had almost lost her, I was relieved as nothing was more important and powerful than the moment when people survived natural disasters and reunited with their loved ones, feeling grateful for having escaped the catastrophe and seeing the importance of cherishing our loved ones because we never know which comes first, tomorrow or a disaster that could take their lives away from us. 
         <br><br>

However, many others were not as lucky as the nurse as they could not escape from the fire in time. I could not bear to imagine and think of the lives perished in the fire, of how hopeless and reluctant they were facing death that their desire to survive and live was so strong but there was no means of escaping and they were left with no other choices but to die from the fire. Watching this documentary made me realize how powerless and helpless we as humans are in front of the powers of nature and natural disasters, that there is really nothing we can do when a fire or storm arrives because we cannot compete with the forces of nature and the only option we are left with is to run for our own safety. 
         <br><br>

Lastly, going back to the topic of the climate crisis, this documentary did a really good job of portraying the negative consequences climate change has on humans through showing the progression of this one natural catastrophe, the Paradise Fire, and how it ruined the lives and communities of people living in that town. It was a heartbreaking documentary to watch and it was such an unfortunate event to the residents of Paradise, but it truly illustrates climate crisis from a humanitarian perspective as Ken mentioned in the film video through as it shows how families and communities were torn apart from this natural disaster and how the people suffered from the pains of losing loved ones and their homes from the fire. This way it is easier to engage with the audience as they are more likely to relate with the experience of the Paradise residents dealing with the fire and it makes it easier for the audience to understand the real-time impacts of climate change on the planet because natural disasters like this fire can happen anywhere, even in the backyards of the audience of this film, and affect anyone, including the audience member. As a result, the audience is more likely to pay attention and learn more about the issue of climate change and what they can do to mitigate this problem. 

         <br><br>

If I were to rate this documentary, I would give it a five out of five because it is a very powerful documentary that can change people’s perceptions towards climate change, and it really opened my eyes and changed my opinions regarding the entire issue of climate change.

I also had to take a moment to regather myself. What hit me the hardest was the story of the farming grandfather who was burned alive from the climbing flames in Concow while trying to save his crops that were his pride and joy. For a young woman to have the image of her grandpa being engulfed in flames while helpless in a wheelchair is horrendous. That is an image that will be in my own mind for a while. I cannot help but wonder if his response to the phone call from his granddaughter to immediately evacuate was just false hope he gave to her. Maybe at that moment, he knew there were only minutes before he was dead and, being handicapped, thought there was no way he could escape. Maybe the only thing left he could do was tell his granddaughter that he would make it out okay.


<br><hr>
I completely agree, watching this film was emotionally difficult at times. I too was drawn to the story about the nurse and her husband, as it forced me for a second to attempt to comprehend what it must be like calling a loved one not knowing whether you, or they, will survive to see them again. When she told the story of them reuniting, of her husband pacing in the driveway, of her running into his arms faster than the car, it made me tear up. I was incredibly thankful that their particular story of the Camp Fire had a happy ending, and believe I felt a fraction of what they felt. The documentary was full of these emotional stories, each one telling a different part of the disaster. These were stories of loss, of redemption, of guilt, of heroism, woven into this hardship.
         <br><br>

Then, I paused, and thought about it. These people’s suffering does not exist in a vacuum. The Camp Fire wasn’t just a freak, random accident. No, these people’s suffering are part of a larger calculation: what corporations call “externalized costs”. 
         <br><br>

To the best of my understanding externalized costs are all the costs that companies don’t have to pay for. For example, the carbon dioxide that fossil fuel companies put into the atmosphere has consequences, or costs: in this case, all the warming that that carbon leads to, and the consequences that come with it. Somebody pays these costs, just not the corporation. This time, Paradise paid the externalized costs. They paid for the faulty equipment of PG&E, they paid for the carbon dioxide we’ve all thrown up into the air. Of course, unlike the way corporations pay, they paid with their lives. 
         <br><br>

We need to start looking at externalized costs as a crime. At the very least, externalized costs imply a company is stealing resources from the earth and consequently the general wealth, as does a logging operation when they “produce” profit using what once were the trees that belonged to the earth and the people, animals, and plants that depended on them. On the more extreme side of things, externalized costs account to manslaughter. The neglect of PG&E to pay to upgrade their equipment, the neglect of our society to invest in better alternatives to fossil fuels and the economic system based upon them, and the neglect of our governments to fund better emergency preparedness programs in light of natural disasters increasing in frequency and severity, are all paid for with the lives of people and all their basic needs such as food, shelter, and water. We will continue paying these externalized costs until we decide to change things. Even then, we may have already accumulated a massive debt.

I like that Ken emphasizes that there already are visible consequences of climate change, it's not something that's going to happen in the near future, it is happening right now.  From here on out we can only hope to stop the inevitable, we cannot reverse what has already been done, nor can we help those who have already suffered the consequences.  The documentary shows us how fires and temperatures rising is one of the biggest threats to life on earth.  Something like sea levels rising is only a risk for those close to the coast, fires are something that will and do affect everyone.

The film, "Fire in Paradise" made me extremely emotional and I felt empathy for those who were affected by the Paradise fire. After watching the film, I spoke to my co-worker about it and he informed me that one of his family members was affected by the fire and their house burned down. It is devastating understanding wildfires and climate change in general do not discriminate; We are all targets. Furthermore, I could not believe how misinformed the residents were during the fire and honestly it made me lose trust with law enforcement and local government. I learned that I need to take these issues seriously. I cannot continue watching these films and understanding the consequences that may arise and do nothing about it. One of the sheriff's stated, "the best person to craft an evacuation plan for you is you" and he's right. I am motivated to create an evacuation plan for myself in Santa Barbara and another for my family in my hometown because if the government fails us, at least we won't fail ourselves.

One comment that bothered me was when a sheriff said, "The plan was implemented. I-I'm very confident in saying it was, it was successful." He mentions it was not flawless, but to call it a success is precocious. They saved thousands of residents and I truly respect them for their work. Period. But there are many things they would have never envisioned happening, happening that day and the plan they implemented was simply not enough. The fire was spreading at a speed unimaginable for law enforcement, firefighters etc. making the plan difficult to abide by. It was heartbreaking when the hospital had to evacuate and the nurses were using their own personal cars to drive patients to safety, even those who had just gotten out of surgery that morning. They need to do better. We all need to do better. 
         <br><br>
I would rate this film a 5/5 because it not only sheds light on the human impact climate change will have/has, but it also allows me to question local government, corporations like PG&E, and more.

I as well felt extremely emotional after watching the devastation that occurred as a result of the Paradise fire. I believe the officials did not take the threat seriously enough at first, and because of this it was able to escalate way out of their control. Although this was a human caused fire, the effects of climate change turned something that would have been a manageable fire into a disastrous fire because of the heavy winds that were brought on by climate change in the area. I feel terrible for the residents that were calling, not knowing what was really going on, and overall just being left in the dark. Yes, telling them the extent might cause a full on panic, but at least give them proper knowledge to make a decision that might save their lives. They were definitely misinformed, the government failed them as far as I'm concerned. I also do not think the plan they implemented is something I would call a success. I respect them for the lives they were able to save, but I feel as though they could have devised a better plan given the circumstances of this horrible fire. However, I still give them major props for being able to work under such stressful conditions and risking their lives to save other people. Besides that though, we need to be aware of what is to come, because this isn't the worst fire we will experience. These wildfires will only manage to become harsher and harsher as climate change advances. We need to be better prepared for the future that we will face.

I agree with your comment. I feel that the film made me very emotional because of everything that was lost during that fire. I also could not believe how phone operators were being misinformed and telling residents that the fire was not a problem. It was very sad how their were people who were not informed to evacuate even though a mass notification could have been sent out to all of the residents but was not used. I agree 100% about not being able to understand that the climate is being effected and is worsening these fires and making them less controllable. In the video "Fire in Paradise", what added to the deadliness of the cave fire were the winds because the winds were blowing the fire in different directions so it was hard to focus on one area to put it out, since there was numerous areas on fire. However, I do feel that a majority of the blame falls onto the corporation PG&E blame because they were not planning on inspecting any of their electricity towers until they needed to and in the case of this fire, it was too late. The film also mentions how PG&E have had fines in the past but continued to operate even after those fines. I feel that if a corporation is responsible for putting people's lives at risk than they should not be operating. Something also needs to be done about climate change because these fires are becoming uncontrollable as is the case in Australia. All of these issues we have gone over stem from climate change. People lives are being ruined from this issue and it is very hard to see people who have the power ignore it. All of the individual stories in the film were so very heartbreaking because many people lost their homes and loved ones in this fire and some of this stemmed from misinformation being provided. I also agree that this video deserves a 5/5 rating because it did a very good job at depicting the severity of this fire and showing that this is a climate change issue. It did not sugarcoat anything, which it shouldn't to show its audience what will continue to happen to our planet if climate change is to worsen.

After watching “Fire in Paradise”, I start to understand how selfish a person or a company can be. In front of the profit, the human will become a devil. I don’t want to blame the PG&E anymore since it can’t save anything. However, I have a question about why PG&E’s violation was discovered after the fire. I mean what were those supervision departments doing before the fire happened. Aren’t these departments working for making sure companies are following the regulation? Is it true that if this fire disaster didn’t happen, the violation of PG&E will still be hiding from the public? I don’t know if there any profit connection between those big companies and supervision departments. I just want to say that once the supervision departments find any violation, they should force the companies to correct it. To borrow from Spiderman, “with great power comes great responsibility.” I wish those big companies to take their responsibility and don’t let people down anymore. 
         <br><br>
The process of this catastrophe is like the shadow of the climate crisis. At first, people think it won’t get too serious. However, until people discover the real consequence and suffer from it, people will start to regret why they didn’t pay more attention before. I don’t want the Earth to become the second “Fire in Paradise.”

The documentary “ Fire in Paradise” authentically displays the rapid spreading speed of a forest fire and people’s helplessness under such unpredictable disasters. When I watched the beginning of the documentary, I did not understand the severity of fire since forest fire is very distant and alien to the most audiences. However, when the scenes move to the local hospital, I was deeply shocked by the spreading speed of fire. In that scene, all the patients were moved out and the fire suddenly surrounded the hospital, covering everything in minutes. Then, the nurse began to show her helplessness when her car was on fire and the temperature is rising. That moment really scared me since human beings seem too insignificant and helpless under the situation. Later, the narrator mentioned that there was still a large number of people stay in their houses and most of them are unlikely to survive. Some of them may not realize the severity in the beginning, but others may not be able to receive the warning signals of evacuation. When people leave their firing cars, they could not find other vehicles to continue escaping. Also, too many cars have broken down on the main road and there were no advanced or prepared tools to deal with them as soon as possible. These lethal problems indicated an unqualified preparation of local government. In the end, they finally find the combustion source which is started by small parts of equipment dropped from a high-voltage electricity tower belonged to PG&E Corporation. Expects also find most electricity towers of the company are outdated. Thus, every tiny problem can be responsible for the huge fire in Paradise. Unlike other environmental documentaries, “ Fire in Paradise” did not emphasize the issue of climate change directly. In fact, climate change plays an unignored role in recent forest fires in California because of the rising temperature and continuous drought.

Although I lived pretty far away from the Camp Fire, I still experienced its effects. School was cancelled for two days last November because of the smoke and poor air quality. Most students were happy about the fact that we got extra days of vacation, but I felt uneasy. Why were they celebrating these circumstances when an entire town was burning to the ground? I helped organize in a fundraiser for the victims of the Camp Fire at my school, yet I still didn’t know much about the Camp Fire besides the fact that the whole town of Paradise was on fire. 
         <br><br>


Several times throughout the documentary, climate change was mentioned as the reason why the fire spread so quickly. A perfect storm. Though the purpose of the movie wasn’t to inform viewers about climate change––rather, to convey the devastating impact to the lives of Paradise’s residents and highlight the great efforts of first responders in an unprecedented situation––I found it quite interesting when looking at it from the lens of a climate change activist. The winds and the dry land are both effects of extreme weather patterns. PG&E not meeting safety standards is neglecting both the prosperity of humans and the environment. 
         <br><br>


This movie made me realize the intensity and severity of the fire. The fact that the Thomas fire, which was once the most destructive fire in California, was in mere miles of Santa Barbara is proof that even the most wealthy people, even the most idyllic environments can experience the horrible impacts of climate change. Climate change doesn’t pick favorites. Both Northern and Southern California have been affected. The poor and the rich, the young and the old, people all around the world––they all face the damage, which means it’s everyone’s responsibility to prevent even worsening climate change.

While watching the film "Fire in Paradise" I felt saddened as I watched individuals battle to get away from the town of Paradise. Hearing some of the 911 dispatch calls and realizing a few people may have not made it out of their homes for being caught was awful. 
         <br><br>

 In spite of the fact that I thought about the fire and had seen photographs on the web, I had not seen the power of it through recordings or that it was so hard to clear. What I preferred about this film was that, instead of spreading out the realities of environmental change, this film shows an outcome that came about because of a worldwide temperature alteration and how it influences our lives.
         <br><br>
This narrative demonstrated that readiness just goes up until a point. The town of Paradise had a genuinely extensive clearing plan that could discharge the city rapidly. Regardless of this, the sheer speed and power of the success filled immediately overpowered the arrangement. 
         <br><br>
Regardless of whether there had been no postponement in prompting the clearing plan, it is indistinct concerning whether everybody would have gotten out in time. The powers of nature were simply too incredible to even think about deterring, and this paints a dismal picture for the not so distant future.

Watching the 911 calls from the people who might have not made it out was also very shocking for me. For a city that prepared and faced true destruction, the power of nature can be too much to face, as we are fueling nature to destroy this planet. I also like how you pointed out that the film is great at showing a real-world outcome of climate change, instead of possible outcomes that could happen. I feel that this method of spreading awareness is much more effective than trying to tell people 'possible' events.

After watching “Fire in Paradise” I felt heartbroken and terrified. Watching recording from the firefighters and policeman’s camera, we could see smoke that turned the sky black, fire embers rushing with the strong wind and burned down anything they touch, the town of Paradise literally turns into hell on Earth. Even though many people managed to get out, there are still some who lost their lives helplessly in the sea of fire.
         <br><br>

One thing that frustrates me was how useless those “emergency evaluation plan binder” and official notification system was when it comes to disaster like the Camp fire. As it stated in the documentary, more than half of the residents in the area didn’t sign up for Code Red(official notification system in Paradise), and those who signed up did not get notification because cell phone towers went down. 
         <br><br>

Around 30,000 people lost their homes and 85 people lost their lives, the Camp Fire was the most destructive and deadliest wildfire in California history. This event once again emphasized how fragile and defenseless we are as a species when facing natural disasters, and how much more we could do to prevent those that could happen in the future.

Having also watched, “Fire in Paradise,” I can say that I felt the same way you did. It was devastating to see an entire town completely destroyed in the span of a couple hours. The entire city of Paradise was razed to the ground and there wasn’t anything the residents could do to stop it. I find it ironic that this would happen in a place called Paradise, because after what happened, it was the complete opposite of paradise. Like you said, the town of Paradise literally turned into what looked like hell on Earth. It is incredibly scary to think that this could be the new reality for many of us who live not only in California, but all over the world, as evident by what is happening in Australia right now. Fire seasons are not only becoming longer, but they are also becoming more dangerous all due to climate change.

         <br><br>

I was also frustrated with the emergency system the town had in place. The notification system failed to notify the residents of the impending danger. Many more were unaware of the true danger the Camp Fire posed to their town all because they did not sign up to receive notifications. Even people who had signed up for the notification never got them. The evacuation plan of the town also annoyed me. The roads were completely congested with cars and firefighters could not get to the places they had to. This was made worse by the fact that even though the town experienced a fire a decade prior, they still did not provide funding to widen roads, especially those that were part of the evacuation route. As a result, many people were trapped within the inferno and had to abandon their vehicles in the middle of the road, thus causing more traffic jams.

"Fire In Paradise" shows the terrifying reality that we can face and do presently face. The personal stories and footage of the people involved in the fires gives us a sense of the desperation trying to leave their burning down city. One thing I realized as someone from northern California, people are not blaming these incidents on climate change but rather the blame is squarely aimed at PG&E. It never even crossed my mind that these fires were the result of climate change before. Blaming the business practice of PG&E is warranted in my opinion because if their equipment were properly maintained, the sparks that start the fire would not have occurred. However, I feel that most people do not look past the start of the fire or at the root of the problem which causes these fires to grow so large, so fast, and so destructive. In my personal experience it seems that people think that PG&E is the sole reason that the Camp fire and other fires happen but do not realize that the effects of climate change accelerate the fire's growth like never before. 
         <br><br>


Holding PG&E accountable is important but I think that most people would stop at that and not attribute the large and fast moving fires as an effect of the lack of rain that is in turn an effect of climate change. PG&E is not even the only power company to be liable for wildfires. The Thomas Fire cause was attributed to the power company Edison and its overhead powerlines coming into contact with one another and causing sparks. The power companies' policies are not updated to include the increased risk of devastating wildfires and because of that, have high chances of starting a wildfire in these new dry and rainless conditions. In order to fight fires resulting from power lines, more maintenance is required for all the equipment as well as implementation of underground power lines that are not going to spark into dry vegetation. They must not have anticipated such things to happen before but now that its effects have been seen in an increasing number of fires, this must happen to prevent more from occurring. If companies that are easily liable for these things to happen do not change in response to climate change, it is almost as much their fault for the wildfires and destruction as it is society's fault for contributing to climate change.

         <br><br>

No matter how much money is needed to update and maintain power systems in dry parts of California and the rest of the world, this does not address the root of the issue but rather it is sort of a band aid fix. If climate change did not result in less rain and dry winds, these fires would not have become the monsters that they did. The wildfires that are now occurring in California that become historically large and devastating are the new normal. The best way to prevent this effect of climate change is to combat climate change itself. I feel like this video focused more on the policies of PG&E causing the large fires. That is important but I feel like putting more blame on power companies distracts from the fact that these catastrophes are a result of climate change and we need to do a better job of informing the public of all factors, no matter how immediate they seem and this can cause more disinformation about climate change.

This film takes its audience on an emotional rollercoaster throughout the whole film. This film is proof that climate change is not political and is affecting us here in America. At the beginning of the film, the people were describing paradise as dream-like and an actual paradise. Everyone who lives there absolutely loves it and thought nothing bad could ever happen. Literally, even Cal Fire didn’t think the fire would reach paradise. I think it was nice to take a break from the films that describe what climate change was and how it was going to affect Earth. Fire in Paradise was a film that showed that climate change is affecting us already and that it continually is becoming a bigger issue. During the lecture, when the student came up and pointed out how the whole city was very conservative but now believed in climate changes really opened my eyes. There are so many people who do not believe the Earth is in danger until their own lives are in danger. 
         <br><br>

The emotion throughout the film was surreal and almost had me in tears. These are real people in the state of California that lost their loved ones and almost lost their own lives. The problem isn’t across the seas anymore, it is right here. That woman had to run through fire due to our mistakes as a country. Some might want to blame those who didn’t alert the residents of their city. But, it is our fault because we continue to pollute the air and warm the atmosphere. All of the developing countries are responsible for the deaths of this fire and the amount of land that was burned. They are also responsible for the increasing number of wildfires throughout California. You would think that once people’s lives were affected IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY, that they might increase the number of laws on emissions, not drop all of them. This is a perfect example of the future we have in store for us if there is not change.
         <br><br>
 For those affected by the Paradise fire or the Thomas fire, I am truly sorry.

“Fire in Paradise” is a type of documentary, which records the biggest fire that happened in California. The emotion brought by this documentary to me is significant. Even though I was not a person who was born and raised in California, I still felt shocked, grieved, and indignant after watching this movie. 

         <br><br>

What caused this fire to happen? To be honest, it is not caused by climate change or global warming, actually, it is caused by the most significant electronic company- PG&E. However, a huge amount of people denounced what PG&E did in this accident. People said that it is all because PG&E did not choose to turn off the electricity on time in order to prevent the loss of profit. People defined this company as “selfish”. I totally agree with what all of these people say about this accident. It is definitely true that PG&E must take a huge part of the responsibility for this fire. If they choose to turn off the electricity at that time, it may not even happen. However, to cool down ourselves and judge this issue fairly, we must consider one question: Do people in this state, this country or this world need to take responsibility for this fire? From my perspective, the answer is “yes”. Without climate change, this fire would not spread so fastly and so seriously. What causes climate change to become a serious problem in our life? The answer is human beings. We must admit this. Just like what policies and governors in this documentary said, they never imagined that this fire would burn so fast and considered that this fire would bring such a serious influence to Paradise. This would not have happened maybe 10 years ago due to the fact that the weather couldn’t be as dry as the condition before the fire took place. The break of the electronic tower belonging to PG&E is just a trigger. 

         <br><br>

We also must recognize and admit our fault in climate change. To admit the consequence unaffectedly, we can make a plan before these kinds of disasters happen in the future and prevent the thing that showed in the documentary happen again. Our mistake is just like a snowball. One person makes it and it may not influence our life. However, more and more people make the same mistake-ignore the climate change- will let this “snowball” accumulate and finally cause an inconceivable disaster that destroys people’s life.

From this work, the audience can clearly see that many people (even the fire alarm center) have insufficient prejudgment about the fire hazard, perfunctory, and finally faced by the facts.
         <br><br>
Therefore, for human beings, any natural disaster cannot be underestimated and must be dealt with seriously. First of all, to explain, in the face of sudden natural disasters, any mentality changes are normal? Some people wait and wait; some people flee quickly; some people kneel and pray ... all these actions are "normal areas." But the question is, how do people adjust their mindsets next? Is it forward or backward? Give up hope or fight hard? This is important. Because at this moment, "the change of mindset" may influence one's future. In the film, rescuers and trapped people gave the four words "positive face" in unison. It is believed that this was not a publicity slogan, but the most authentic voice in people's hearts at that time.
         <br><br>
There is no doubt that compared to the city's fire prevention system which can be used for prevention and control, there is much more that can be done in the face of nature. It is said that mountain fires are often caused by human disasters, but climate change has made forests more and more prone to fire. The natural disasters that are formed are often caught off guard, leaving a mess in the end.

The film “Fire in Paradise” captivated my attention due to the rivetting recollections of disasters and the action movie-like scenes. The facts about the Paris fire and the behind the views of PG&E and what they had to do with the lights was captivating.  It made me realize the morals the company has and that they must update their old technology not to catch counties on fire.  
         <br><br>

It was especially heartbreaking hearing the stories of people that didn't make it out.  The grandpa that was disabled and found near his bucket of water.  The systems for alerting people also must be updated so that everyone knows whats going on.
         <br><br>

I found it especially shocking that people were dead stopped in traffic as the fire was all around, and people weren't able to breathe. Seeing all those cars stopped while everything around them was on fire was genuinely terrifying.  I didn't, however, find the background on how roads to escape and how they would find the budget being beneficial because if people were just warned sufficiently and in a timely manner, there probably would not have been a hold-up.

Watching the film, I was extremely saddened and shocked to see the impact of the Paradise fire. Growing up in California I have always heard of fires happening around the state, but for the past few years I have seen these fires get worse and worse. One thing I did not know about this situation is that when the fire first started it was a small fire, but because of its location the firefighters could not get to it to put it out. I found this extremely scary, because I always thought that firefighters would be able to get almost anywhere to put the fire out and if this happens again we do not know how much worse the results can be. Thousands of people lost their homes, a loved one, or even their own lives due to the result of these fires that keep happening in California. I was extremely upset to hear that the people of Paradise and the other cities that were affected were not informed correctly. More people could have survived if they were told to evacuate sooner and if they were better informed about what exactly is happening. For example, the mom who refused to leave with her daughter because she didn’t believe they had to evacuate died in the fire. This in particular is also terrifying, because I always thought that if something was ever happening that put my life in danger I would be notified by the police to get away to somewhere safe, but these people weren’t told that until it was too late. Seeing that there were so many people trying to get out that it created so much traffic and people were stuck is also terrifying, because it showed me that if I’m ever in that situation I may not be able to get out, even if I wanted to. In the film, they say how Paradise was prepared in case a fire happened, but they never expected something as big as this. If they weren’t able to get through it, then what are other cities that are not as prepared as Paradise going to do if it ever happens to them. I was not shocked to hear that PG&E were responsible for the fire, but I was upset to hear that they had a long list of safety concerns they ignored. PG&E had caused many other incidents and were even on probation a few times, but since its a corporation they have been able to get away with it. The company was warned that their towers were old and faulty, but they kept a don’t fix it until it breaks mentality, which is why so many accidents have happened. PG&E have to be held accountable for everything they have caused and they have to fix all of their faulty lines before they cause more devastation.

I agree that Fire in Paradise does a good job of captivating attention and drawing out emotion.   I think this is needed when it comes to our discussion on climate change because I do not believe that any further appeal to logic will convince people the change their habits.  We need to see the devastation and  feel the pain of the people affected by climate change for those who are not entirely convinced of climate change to change their minds.  It was horrifying to hear the residents talk about trying to leave their homes that were burning, and it would surprise me if that did not open the eyes of climate change deniers.
         <br><br>


I remember in San Francisco having a hard time breathing during the paradise fires.  I also remember thinking that some of the particles I was breathing in could be someones house or even someone who did not get out.  While that is extremely morbid, it nevertheless shows that mother nature does not discriminate, and does not hold humans in a higher regard.

I strongly agree with most of the comments that point out the feelings of despair and tragedy that is associated with “Fire in Paradise.” This documentary takes an emotional approach that innately touches each of us by portraying authentic fear, loss, guilt, and anger in the context of the events in the town of Paradise during the Camp Fire. The most emotional and frightening scene for me was the evacuation of the hospital and the moments immediately after, when it seemed as if the whole surroundings were on fire. I can only imagine that watching the fiery, red embers fall around the vehicles like rain was an unforgettably traumatic image, and it triggered this profoundly alarming sense in me as if I was watching a suspenseful film, as a few people have already pointed out. 

         <br><br>

I think it is of the utmost importance to emphasize climate change’s impact on our emotional being as a result of the exposure to traumatic events such as the Camp Fire. It considers the fact that the evidence of the climate crisis is not an issue of politics, reaches beyond the scope of science, and affects all communities of people, both physically and emotionally. Without such consideration, it may well have been difficult to connect with the citizens of Paradise as many of us had.

The film “Fire in Paradise” is a really moving piece that breaks my heart. Unlike other films and articles that we have analyzed that focused on using scientific evidence and detailed statistics to logically appeal to the audience, this film, however, takes on a unique approach to emotionally appeal to the audience by re-visualizing the horrible campfire. It was almost unbelievable to see how far the fire is able to spread under such a short period of time; it was even out of the fire department’s expectation in the sense that they did not imagine such a terrible incident could happen. Hearing the records of many incoming phone calls in which the callers were anxiously and horrified to report the thick smoke in the sky, and the ashes falling around, I felt extremely attached to this film. 

         <br><br>

Thoroughly thinking about this traumatic incident, I soon realized that the dry, hot summers and the winds in California could act as perfect conditions that give birth to such strong and detrimental wildfires. Moreover, this film successfully highlighted the unexpected, unpredictable, and chaotic nature of wildfires, bringing an emotional shock to the audience. By inviting the survivors to recount their personal stories of experiencing the fire, we, as the group who really cares for environmental problems related to climate change, could easily emphasize with those people and thus understand the situation much better. As climate change issues become more and more severe, we can sadly foresee a future with more and more environmental disasters, which no doubt will be much more extreme, unpredictable, chaotic. Over 80 people perished in the Paradise fire incident. I am horrified to even imagine how many more lives, both humans, animals, and plants will be impacted if such extreme disasters become normal situations on our planet. It’s our time now to fix it.

Just like you, I found this film absolutely heart breaking. I had tears in my eyes at many points throughout the film. I think your analysis of how this documentary has an emotional appeal by including real tragedies from the actual fire is spot on. I also think this film does a good job of interviewing the fire captains and firefighters in addition to interviewing the people of Paradise because it provides an insight into the logistic struggles these officials had to manage, as well as how their decisions affected the people of the town. When the girl who lost her mother in the fire after her mother refused to evacuate with her mentioned, an alert system through something like CODE RED would have been beneficial to her family, I found myself getting angry towards the fire officials for not alerting the public in a better, more efficient manner. However, after the fire captain explained that they simply did not have a protocol for such a rapidly spreading fire, and that the transportation infrastructure of the city simply did not support the evacuation of all the people of Paradise, I understand their hesitation in alerting everyone. Additionally, I do believe that it is an individual's responsibility to look out for their own safety. 

         <br><br>

What I found interesting was the last 10 minutes in which the documentary begins to shift the focus onto PG&E. This company from which my power comes from back home in NorCal has been involved in a gas pipeline fire in San Bruno in 2010 which I recall watching on the news growing up. The fact that they have repeatedly caused such disasters, have violated their probation, and that a consultant had cautioned them of their malpractice, yet they still are unable to control the consequences of their actions is beyond me. My friends and family back home are directly affected by the red flag power cut off days that they have began enlisting because of decreased liability. In some ways, I don't blame them, because I rather them cut off power for a little bit than to let their pipelines and power lines cause another fire. It's just sad that it has come to this point. 
         <br><br>


Overall, this is a very powerful and well made film that appeals to emotion and makes me feel the urge to do something.

Similar to your experience, the emotional weight of the film was definitely fundamental to my perception of the wildfire that occurred in Paradise and the entirety of the process the civilians and firefighters endured. I don't remember hearing about this fire two years ago at all so the fact that the Camp Fire is the most destructive fire in California history was appalling to me. Specifically, the video recordings of the actual fire itself and accounts of the victims stood out to the most as I sympathized with their situation. When the nurse shared her experienced of being surrounded by fire on the road and believing she was going to die while her husband was incapable of helping her, I was deeply saddened and finally understood the greater dangers presented by wild fires. In addition, the girl's mother who stayed at home and believed she would be fine since there wasn't an evacuation notification was also disheartening as all it took was the police to issue the notification yet chose not to. The authorities' lack of familiarity and preparation for such a fire demonstrates a situation that was out of their capability to deal with, only presenting the immeasurable impacts that the consequences of climate change come with.

Living in Southern California, wild fires that occurred never directly affected the city I lived in or even the ones immediately nearby so I never fully comprehended the destructive impact of the fires. Such conditions of rare and supporting wind conditions for the wildfire produced by climate change highlights the changes we may not have expected to see from what I typically heard about climate change prior to this class. Rather than just being rising sea levels, the conditions that Paradise held worsened the response from authorities to perfectly respond and evacuate all citizens in the most effective way. This response itself highlights the unknowing factors in place of such horrific natural events that will be expanded upon by climate change and may prove impossible to consider all implications and fail-safes in order to protect every individual.

I completely feel with you and your experience with the emotional weight of this documentary. While all the readings, movies and lectures have brought about emotions of anger and outrage, this one took a more despondent route, and I found myself being moved to tears. The ingeniousness about this movie is that it makes the problem of climate change way more imaginable and realistic in many people's minds. It is not simply a convention we read about, statistics we compute or stories we hear about far, far away. It is now happening in our own backyard. This is done by using many different people's anecdotes and seeing second hand through the survivors' anecdotes what it is like. I keep thinking back to the cave fire that happened near Santa Barbara only a few months ago. It was around 11 miles away from downtown Santa Barbara, only 3 miles further than Paradise was to the campfire. And yet because of climate change and all the right conditions, paradise was completely engulfed in flames within hours of the fire's ignition. What if the wind was stronger that day? What if it didn't snow on the mountains? Are thoughts that run through my head. Because if we do not stop and take a look at what the climate has become like, maybe in the next decade, a wildfire that burns through 10-15 miles suddenly will become our new norm.
         <br><br>

One thing that really resonated with me is when the firefighter talked about how in the mid-1980s firefighters had to fight off wildfires that lasted one-two maybe three weeks at most, but then the periods would subside, they would have time to re-group and get ready for the next cycle. But NOW, in the current fire environment, the season is much longer, summer drier, hotter, less humid, and typically temperatures in winters have been on the lower end of average. This information really freaked me out, because seeing what happened in Paradise, I fear what will continue to happen if California got even hotter in the coming years. What town will become the new Paradise? To conclude I just wanted to share some statistics from the movie that I found very powerful: 
         <br><br>
- The fire was spreading at a rate of 80 football fields a minute. 
         <br><br>
- Analysis shows that human-caused climate change has doubled the incidence of wildfires. 
         <br><br>
- 10 of the 20 most destructive fires in California have happened in the last 4 years. 
         <br><br>
- It took only 4 hours for all of Paradise to be destroyed. 
         <br><br>
- Burned 153,000 Acres, the Area the size of Chicago. 
         <br><br>
- Over 30,000 people lost their homes, 85 lost their lives.

I feel like I had a very similar reaction to this documentary to yours. I too, had a very emotional reaction, especially since I have grown up in a town that has been threatened by wildfires several times. This film really made me think about all of the people that I know that have been through this and how many times my family and I have been close to going through this. I agree that this film is effective in communicating its point by using this appeal to our emotions in order to get people to care about the issue. I also agree that the documentary successfully demonstrated the nature of wildfires by showing how quickly they can spread and how difficult it can be to slow them down. From experience I can say that wildfires create an extremely chaotic and panicked feeling because of how quickly they appear and become a threat. I also agree with you that it is extremely worrisome to think about how much worse these conditions will continue to get every year.

<br><hr>

I found this film to be emotionally moving as well. This was not filled with statistics and data to explain to us what climate change is and how bad it can be. This gave us a real perspective that honestly could've been any one of the students at this university. Calls and videos, not even professionally done and taken from a phone. There's nothing more convincing than what reality has to offer. It really is like they take you to the scene themselves, and that's what really caught my eye about this film. It fills you with horror and sadness and anxiety. 
         <br><br>

I also agree that this film is able to effectively communicate the fact that wildfires can spread quickly and can't be slowed down easily. Just this past quarter, there were fires on the 154 that could be seen from IV and the campus. I remember just driving toward downtown and seeing the flames flying up along the mountain ridge, and I was just shocked at the image. I've had experiences with Northern California fires causing thick smog and unhealthy air quality at my high school, but I've never seen the fire with my own eyes. Then, I remember stopping for gas and seeing ash fall from the sky, and that's when the reality of it all really hit me. All of the chaos and panic that I felt was nothing compared to those who were in danger up on that mountain and whose homes were close to being engulfed in flames. I couldn't even imagine being up there, like the people affected by the fire in the film, and thinking that maybe my life was about to end right there.
         <br><br>

Overall, this film really captured the essence of wildfires and the chaos, panic, and heartbreak that they create from their dangerous power and unpredictability.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the film “Fire in Paradise” is unique among other films by showing the emotional side of the people who experienced the wildfire event in Paradise. Although it is important to mention statistics and other facts, I agree with you that it is also important to include people’s stories on how the climate crisis is affecting their homes and lives. By seeing and listening to what other people experience due to wildfire destructions and other incidents, we can learn and try to find ways to help them out, and even connect with their stories. These stories open up the disastrous nature of the climate crisis and are a glimpse to the consequences that should be taken into account. Moreover, I also agree with what you said about the film highlighting the “unexpected, unpredictable, and chaotic nature of wildfires.” These terms are important in trying to comprehend this issue. This climate crisis that is happening right now is beyond unexpected and even unpredictable to many inhabitants. We who live in California, do not really expect such things as fires to be as intense as the Camp Fire, but rather see the wildfires as “normal” and not as severe effects of a changing climate.Yet, this view of percieving it as "normal" should change and rather be about "taking action."

<br><hr>
I agree with you in that I also found this film incredibly moving. Like Ken said, it really gave a "human face" to the climate crisis. I appreciated the fact that it was different from other films that it shows more "emotion" rather than mainly facts and statistics. It was depressing to see how unprepared the town of Paradise was in the face of the Camp Fire and how it completely ravaged the town in such a short period of time. Hearing the survivors' stories was heartbreaking---these people grew up in that town and made many memories there, only to have the Camp Fire destroy everything they loved. To make matters worse, over 80 people unfortunately perished in the fire. The film is very effective in communicating the raw emotion the people of Paradise felt after and during the tragedy, and how crucial it is to have a better system to quickly alert citizens of dangerous events. 
         <br><br>

The Camp Fire is the deadliest and most destructive fire ever to exist in California, and it frustrates me that it was sheer negligence from PG&E that led to it. The last part of the film touches upon PG&E's carelessness and I was unsurprised to see that they are a repeat offender in causing incidents. I really hope that no more deadly wildfires occur, but seeing how frequent these fires are and how people seem to be denying the climate crisis, I feel hopeless and pessimistic that things will be changed.

<br><hr>

I remember when I was younger a family friend’s house caught on fire and he lost most of his belongings. My heart shattered to pieces when I talked to him and even to this day I hurt for him and his family because of what they had to go through. This film was really emotional because when I think of anyone who has been affected by the many fires that have occurred my heart hurts for them just how it did many years ago for my friend. So many fires have been occurring in California and it’s frightening to know that you can lose everything in a matter of seconds. 
         <br><br>

Lives have been changed forever and some have been lost because of the climate crisis. Living beings and our planet is being harmed at the cost of us living in luxury and it is not worth it. We are ruining everything we touch and affecting the lives of everything around us. The fires are just one of the consequences of climate change.


<br><hr>
Hearing the survivors tell their personal stories was definitely heartbreaking. I think if more people learn about the survivors and hear their first-hand experiences with the devastating consequences of climate change, we can spread more awareness about the urgency of the issue and demand change. Emotional appeal has a lot of power to personally reach a wide audience and change people's mindsets. For example, Greta Thunberg utilizes emotional appeal in her strongest arguments to reach a global audience, and her speeches definitely create a sense of urgency for millions of people. We need to do whatever it takes to prevent more of these chaotic and deadly events from happening in the future.
<br><hr>
Just like what you said, I found this documentary "Fire in Paradise" to be much more impactful than other things I have read or watched. Seeing people actually recount their experiences with the paradise fire makes people watching it actually empathize it, just like the previous comment said. Hearing how much it impacted each personal life, made me so scared for myself and my loved ones with fires in California being so common nowadays. With fires being so common, I'm very sad to see how PG&E has escaped legal consequences, with their monopoly over it. I feel like they should be held more responsible for all the fires they have caused and all the lives they have ruined. Hearing about how unprepared everyone is shows just how we need to prepare more for these disasters as they are so common, and could literally come anyway with these conditions. I believe families living in high risk areas should be completely prepared for the worst and learn to never ignore warnings. Over 30,000 acres were burnt, and over 85 people died and yet many people still do not believe in global warming which is so very tragic.

It was entirely devastating to watch the “Fire in Paradise” documentary, witnessing the demolition of an entire town from the perspective of fleeing residents. When I heard the news of the fire in real time, I recall the crisis lasting for weeks as people pleaded for aid for fire victims. I was completely blown away by the timeline of the fire, not realizing how unbelievably rapid the spread of the fire and downfall of Paradise was, occurring in less than half a day. I found myself getting angry as I watched the film, feeling as though so much went wrong along the way: the initial ignition by PG&E, the lack of communication to Paradise police, the hectic evacuation process, etc. While I was upset by these things, I also tried to recognize that the Paradise fire was wholly unprecedented and unexpected, making even the most extensive evacuation plans that they had prepared entirely insufficient. Overall, this film was informative and intriguing but simultaneously tragic as viewers watched the victims of the fire relay their world being shattered in the span of a day.

The travesties like those shown in this documentary are a huge part of the reason I'm for the nationalization of PG&E. Their irresponsibility and incompetence were deafening while watching this, and I cannot see them being owned privately for too much longer. Scott Wiener has introduced a bill to make them state-owned, and I genuinely support this with all of my heart. 
<br><br>
PG&E, just... god, everything they've done. They didn't repair, they shut things down now and it still causes fire... they're entirely incompetent, and they always will be. They really do need to be owned publicly.

<br><hr>
I feel the complete same way, Fire in Paradise shows us how quickly a fire can get out of control and shows how it was a huge Castro-he to begin with. I felt that so much more could have been done but at the same time who's to say what to do in that current situation. None of us are firefighters or fire Marshalls, no matter how frustrated we become of the what if this or what if we did that, we can't really give our input as long as we actually lived through it, actually experienced it. I feel that because many people were in a state of shock, they could not believe what was happening that their response time was delayed by a long period of time, perhaps why the fire did get so out of control. It is hard to put yourself in the victims shoes when you haven't gone through something so dire, it was a life or death situation. This documentary just provides another reason to acknowledge climate change for what it really is and provides us the necessary ways on how to combat a fire this big, a way to maintain the next one so that we are better off prepared.

I never got the chance to really look into the Camp Fire in Paradise. I was evacuated during the Woolsey Fire the day after a mass shooting in my city. I was so shocked and distracted that I did not really worry too much about what was going on in northern California. The fire took out a house in an adjacent neighborhood to mine, and me and my family were fortunate enough to evacuate early and have a place to evacuate to. Despite the fact that we left earlier than the mandatory evacuations were in place (~11:00pm Nov 8), we still caught traffic. I have friends who left later who were stuck in even heavier traffic. Luckily, most of the streets and highways in and around my city have 3 lanes. However, most of the damage was done in Malibu, about 15-20 miles from my house. In that area, the roads have fewer lanes and there are not as many routes out of the city. When I watched the documentary on Paradise, I thought of the images I saw in Malibu.
<br><br>


This was the first time I got a good look at what exactly happened in the Camp Fire. What struck to me was how little communication there was between the people of Paradise, the firefighters, and the police. People were told that they did not have to leave despite the fact that the sky was orange and ash was falling from the sky. By the time mandatory evacuation orders were in place, it was too late. The narrow streets were jammed with cars and the lack of manpower along with the narrow roads made escape seem impossible.  
<br><br>


Obviously, a lot of the blame has to go to PG&E, the company who let their electrical towers get far past the age where they could be dangerous. However, one thing that the documentary highlighted on was the lack of a good evacuation plan. They evacuated part of the city a couple years before and it was a disaster. They couldn't get the funding to expand the road or make any real improvements to the evacuation routes. 

<br><br>

This made me think, maybe it's not such a bad thing to have taxes that improve our roads and help pay our police officers, firefighters, and paramedics. In 2018, Prop 6 in California proposed to repeal the gas tax and thus give less funding to public works such as roads. No matter how much I hate paying $3.80 per gallon for gas, I now realize that it is probably for the best that gas is that price, as just a couple days after election day the fires hit. I am thankful that we had such great, wide roads in my city, as without that, who knows what would have happened.

The Paradise Fire film was unbelievable, literally looks so surreal. The California Fire department thought it was a manageable fire but they couldn't get to it, I feel like that's what played a part in it’s spreading. However the PG&E was like 98% at fault, they knew their power lines were super old and a hazard yet they didn’t bother changing them. The last couple of minutes of the film talked about how many lawsuits the PG&E had and it was literally so many. The lawsuit that they would be getting for this fire would be $10.5 billion. It sounds like a lot but the lives lost and damages to this whole place cannot be forgotten nor forgiven just because of the money. This whole situation could have been avoided if they had just listened the first time they cause damage. The PG&E has to face their consequences, like someone said in the film, “if they were a person they’d be in prison by now,'' they should be in jail or something. I know the PG&E is literally the largest company of electricity but throwing money at something isn’t going to solve much. 
<br><br>
Seeing the fire and hearing how 911 operators could not do much to help people was so devastating. There were so many people calling and asking if they should evacuate, and they did but when they were finally told is was too late. I feel like yeah the fire wasn’t a danger yet but as a precaution they should've made people leave early. When people were finally told to leave it was too late because everyone at once was trying to leave and this caused huge traffic jams. Just hearing that so many cars were on fire and that people were literally stuck in their burning homes saddened me so much. I think there were a couple people to blame but the main ones at fault were the PG&E. I don’t think I could ever imagine myself in a situation like that, it's so scary to even think about.

If you have not witnessed it, I strongly implore you to go check out the aftermath of the Cave Fire yourself. Whenever I ride my bike by that ashen ground, I have to stop in awe of the destructive power of nature. Now imagine that, but in an area the size of Chicago. That's how big the Camp Fire was. But even that is a microcosm of the larger crisis at hand, at what is to come if we don't take action, not only in terms of worsening fires but the death of the world's most massive ecosystems that support human life.  Just as the old and sick were the first casualties in the Camp Fire, so too will the geographically and economically disadvantaged peoples of the world suffer first, and the most, from the climate crisis. 
<br><br>


The analogy starts to break down when considering the reactions to each of these crises. A massive wildfire is tangible to the senses: one can smell the smoke, feel the heat, see the flames. It's the kind of thing humans are evolutionarily designed to detect and run away from. On the other hand, CO2 is a colorless, odorless gas that results from living a lifestyle that has become normalized in the past century. Due largely to the melting permafrost and other factors, it spreads like wildfire anyways, while many refuse to see the cracks beginning to form. The climate crisis has cascading effects that are extremely difficult to foresee, the only certainty being that they will be immensely destructive. For instance, as Ken mentioned, the Thomas Fire later led to massive landslides in Montecito. To this day, Mountain Drive has a massive ravine on the east side, turning into a river after strong rains. If the ultra-wealthy that own many of the homes in the Montecito hills are not safe from the effects of the climate crisis (i.e. worsening natural disasters like wildfires), then who is?

One of the most troubling parts about this film was PG&E’s decision to not turn off the power line. Not only was it grossly negligent, especially because of their already long history of safety violations and destructive fires in California, which include a gas explosion in 2010, but it was extremely unconscionable as it put the lives of 40,000 people at risk. What’s more is that PG&E was warned that the equipment which ended up causing the Paradise Fire was aging and most likely needed to be replaced. The corporation had all of the knowledge and resources they needed that may have prevented the campfire, but they chose not to act for the purpose of saving some money. 
<br><br>
Hearing the stories of the people affected was very emotional. It was horrifying to see how quickly the fire took over Paradise, and sad to see that some people decided to remain at home and ultimately died because the fire grew so rapidly. As a Californian, it's shocking and horrifying to see one of our communities ruined by a fire that could have been prevented, especially because many of us have family and friends that may have lived in Paradise or one of the neighboring towns. In some parts of the documentary, the scenes of the fire reminded me of the third panel of The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch. The Paradise fire looked apocalyptic. I was shocked to hear that ten of the twenty most destructive fires in California have happened over the past four years. There's visible proof that human caused climate change has doubled the intensity of wildfires in the west since 1984, and the natural vegetation in California has been reduced to kindling for the flames as rising temperatures have dried out the land, yet the public is still slow to make progress in preventing future disasters. It is scary to  think about the future catastrophes that will occur as the climate changes even more drastically.

"Fire in Paradise" taught me about a fire that I had no idea the magnitude of. I had heard of the camp fire but I had no clue the extent of the damage that the fire caused. The scenes of the hospital being evacuated were particularly hard hitting because you could get an idea of the panic and danger of the situation. The nurses and emergency responders efforts saved countless lives as they evacuated all the patients, using their own cars when the ambulances ran out. The fact that the fire was caused by PG&E electric company's faulty equipment that they had been informed was already exceeding the average life expectancy means that this was an avoidable tragedy. If they had maintained their equipment or at least not left it up to chance then billions of dollars worth of damage would never happened and there would have been no casualties. Unfortunately this is not the case, so PG&E deserve the criminal charges against them. However, this may not be effective enough because the company has a past of fires and nothing has changed to stop that.

Same. I was dreaded to watch the hospital scenes. I feel their helplessness, seeing all those fire burning so close to people and the air filled with embers and smoke. Just imagine how those people who just went out of surgery rooms were put into danger again immediately.
<br><br>

And I definitely agree with you that PG&E should take major responsibility for this and be punished severely. However, that shouldn't be enough. I somehow feel there is a potential question that this documentary is trying to answer: "who should we blame in this case?" A woman in this film said she blamed herself, blamed authority, blamed that the evacuation order was not given properly. But even in this case, if the notification was made sooner enough and everyone listened to the order and get out of their homes, the road won't have the capacity to hold them, and they would still be stuck on the road. Another noteworthy point made in this documentary is that the town Paradise was even very aware of the wildfire issues ahead, and they had a plan and have had rehearsals. If the fire starts to emerge in places that have not experienced in dealing with those situations before, the consequences could be so much worse. What could be done enough will never be enough eventually. The wildfires would be more and more frequent, aggressive, and unpredictable if we don't give enough attention to the climate issue. 
<br><br>

It was my first year of college when Thomas Fire happened. It was my first time seeing the sky be so deadly red, and there were full of ashes on the ground. It felt like the end of the world. 
<br><br>
When Ken mentioned that the Thomas fire was close to Montecito, the wealthy part of California, I remembered that people were caring about how those celebrities were doing at that time on Twitter. This reminded me of a comment that Ken said during the lecture -- if those celebrities have so much influence, and they actually have experienced the wildfire burning so close to them, threatening their homes and families, why this has not wakened them up and used their power to speak about the climate issue. The attention to the climate problem is so not enough and we need more influential people to help with it.

Like many of these comments, I found the film “Fire in Paradise” to be almost depressing in a sense, it forces the viewer to come face to face with the victims of the Paradise Fire and really shows the levels of trauma and stress endured by those caught in the fire. Many times, throughout this documentary I found myself questioning why was Ken making us watch this? The overall tone of the film was saddening and I felt almost guilty that I hadn’t given much thought to the aftermath of the Paradise Fire beforehand. 
<br><br>

But then I realized that this was what I needed, a reality check. I needed to see how destructive and traumatic wildfires have been in Paradise, to truly understand the consequences of the Climate Crisis. While this documentary was not directly related to the content of the class, I feel that it was still extremely relevant and important. Like I said above, I knew the statistics of the Camp Fire but hearing the first-hand accounts and seeing the footage really helped me gain a better understanding of the event.
<br><br>

 This documentary was a way for me to see how individuals were affected by this fire, they were no longer just statistics. The documentary gives them identities. Those affected by the fire were no longer just strangers, instead, they were nurses, granddaughters, or daughters. By including this documentary, Ken is allowing the class to see the consequences of the Climate Crisis firsthand. We aren’t seeing what the potential effects of Climate Change could be in the future, instead, we are seeing what has already happened as a result of this Climate Crisis.
<br><br>

While I could focus on the specifics of this fire, I felt that the more impactful part of this documentary was in the people. One could choose to focus on the logistics of the fire, such as the cause or consequences of it. Instead, I think that it is important for the viewer to understand that this might not be an isolated incident. Without changes being enacted, this could just be the first of many large wildfires.

I agree that a reality check can really put the dangers and impacts of climate change into perspective. At times, heart wrenching visuals and first hand accounts by actual people is just more effective than statistics and data. As a result, I too believe that although this documentary did not directly focus on climate change, it was beneficial in helping people see the tangible impact of climate change on human lives.


<br><hr>
I totally agree that "Fire in Paradise" was a depressing film, especially after having to listen to those people on the phone with 911 essentially be burned alive while talking to dispatchers were there but unable to help. No matter what you think about the Camp Fire or even Climate Change in general, seeing such a scarring and helpless situation through a documentary on PBS, where its available for free to be watched by virtually anyone,  is quite the outlook-changing experience. 
<br><br>
While I do also agree that this film was a reality check for people, especially living in California who have most likely seen these fires in person, I think that a lot of people who see the documentary won't take it as seriously as it should be taken. Even from my own point of view, if i see a snow-storm on the east-coast or a huge hurricane hitting the southeast US, I can only feel so much for those affected. Sure, its a terrible situation, but everyone has their own problems to care about so its impossible to care about everything at the same time. Until someone is faced with the problem in front of them, a majority of us will only be so invested in a cause. 
<br><br>
As a California resident my entire life, its hard to watch this documentary with a hopeful outlook to the future. Not only are people literally being burned to a crisp in their home towns, but there almost nothing that someone can do until its too late. Unfortunately, i think that this will be a recurring theme in the climate crisis, where people wont really care about their actions and impact on the climate until its too late. 
<br><br>
The time for change is now, and there needs to be a serious call for action if we dont want to end up as parts of a documentary ourselves.

I can clearly remember the day this fire happened, all though I was not nearly close in range to it clouds of smoke covered the sky, it genuinely looked like an apocalypse or something of the sort was happening. Ashes were falling from the brown/red sky and we were let out early from school to go home because the air quality was so bad. While watching this film I was engulfed in the emotions of the people who's houses were destroyed, the nurse who never thought she'd see her husband again. Tears filled my eyes and chills ran down my spine. I couldn't imagine going through that kind of pain and fear, but the sad truth is, it is our future. If we continue to live and raise our families in California, fires will most likely be the biggest causes of destruction.
<br><br>
That being said, many people argue that it is the fault of PG&E and they could have done things to prevent it, although I do believe this is true, logistically it is almost impossible to prevent all risk of wild fires, as some of the electric power stations and lines are in such remote areas they are very hard to access and replace, especially because there is such a large extent of them. Perhaps if there was more government spending on the electrical safety these remote power lines would have been taken better care of and this event wouldn't have occurred. However it is not just the fault in the electrical power lines, but the fault in all the other factors that have lead to the climate rise that caused this fire, which must also be prevented in order to stop these major fires. I can imagine, by the way we are headed, that one day most of California land will be burned up destroying millions of homes, lives, and people.

I remember this day too. I remember the way the smoke stung my throat. I had driven through Paradise many times before, and I remember following this fire closely because I knew people in many towns around the fire. I remember the smoke in the sky, and it's so scary and apocalyptic feeling, it makes me wonder what children living around the area felt / thought. I wonder if people will begin to support change now that this issue is in their backyard. Hearing the calls to 911 about the smoke was a terrifying part of the movie, the woman asking if she should evacuate reminded me of my mother when fire struck my hometown.

As much as this fire was directly the result of human error, and that error includes the lack of policy on PG&E to update their towers and take responsibility for the damage they are causing to their customers, climate change is still the bigger issue here. If California were less continually dry and drought - ridden, our landscape would be much more moist and resistant to catching fire. Although wildfires are a huge part of California's history, we have also historically had some killer storm seasons, which evened out the dry climate and helped create new landscapes after a wildfire. Without that amount of downpour, we have no hope of regrowing California's famous natural landscape.
<br><br>
It does make me angry how many wildfires PG&E has started, and how easy it is to avoid accountability because they're an important resource for a lot of the country. If their electrical tower has been there for 100 years, but it's hard to get to, how did it get there in the first place? If they had the resources then, they have the resources now. It's hard and expensive to avoid PG&E's clutches, but we can vote to elect leaders who will change that, allow for healthy competition in the electricity market instead of a monopoly from a company that always has and always will value profits over lives.

I think that this film was very effective in evoking concern around climate change. The scariest part to me was hearing about all the planning that the firefighters had done to try and prevent a situation like this. What really struck me was when they explained that the beginning of the fire could have been containable, but because of the small roads they couldn’t get trucks to the fire and because of the high winds they couldn’t get helicopters there either. It goes to show that we can plan and plan for an event like this, but nature is still going to be one step ahead and we won’t be able to stop it. What’s even scarier is that these events are occurring more frequently. Ken mentions the fires currently happening in Australia. The fact that these fires are four times as large as the 15 biggest fires in California combined is crazy!! I can’t even fathom that! If it took them two weeks to put out the fire in Paradise, how long will it take them to put out a fire that much bigger?

When I was watching the documentary "Fire in Paradise," I was astonished by how fast the fire spread that eventually became a catastrophe. While many people blame PG&E for not shutting down the electricity in high wind, they usually don't realize that climate change is responsible for the increasing rate of wildfire in California. With the 2°C increase in global temperature, the air in California became hotter and less humid and created the unprecedented wildfire in California.  
<br><br>
As human beings, we should well aware that what we have done to the environment in the past would have serious consequences one day, with various forms that far beyond our imagination. The wildfire in California is merely one of the consequences caused by climate change. We should take immediate action to respond to climate change before we lost our natural habitat.

I completely agree with you. After watching the documentary, "Fire in paradise," I was surprised about the destructiveness of the fire itself. I had briefly heard about the 'paradise fire' before but I was not aware of the severity of this event. Moreover, this documentary does not focus on the larger issue of climate change but instead, it focuses on this specific disaster. People blame PG&E for not taking preventative action regards to the fire but I agree with your assertion that we cannot blame one individual company for this devastating wildfire. Our collective negligence as a human race has caused this climate crisis; consequently, climate change is exacerbating conditions that nurture wildfires. For us to prevent a disaster like that we need to address the larger issue that is climate change.

I had a visceral reaction to this film. This was due in part to the fact that as a Californian, I couldn't help but feel connected to the fire in a different way than hearing about permafrost melting in Greenland or flooding in Miami. While on an intellectual level I understand the severity of all these occurrences and am deeply concerned about them, there is something different about seeing this happen in your own backyard. I saw the smoke from that fire and had friends that were personally affected in Paradise. It is yet another reminder that the devastating effects of climate change are already here and having direct effects on all of our lives. The other cause of my emotional reaction to this film was the incredible images of the fire that were included. In previous articles I have read about climate change, writers often allude to the apocalyptic nature of climate change, eluding to uninhabitable temperatures, mass extinction, and large floods. This film added images to these commentaries, which sometimes can seem exaggerated or alarmist. Video clips of complete darkness at 9:00 in the morning while patients were being evacuated from a hospital that was surrounded by walls of the fire looked supernatural and undoubtedly apocalyptic. Additionally, the emotional testimony of people who almost lost their loves or lost family members added a personal component to the film that shows the human cost of climate-related disasters such as this one. 
<br><br>
Many of the comments on this post deal with the fact that the film did not deal directly with climate change in a significant way. However, I think that the way this film talks about climate change is more realistic and scientifically accurate. The major problems that are happening and will continue to get worse due to climate change are not entirely new occurrences. We have always had devastating floods, hurricanes, and fires. However, climate change is making it worse. We are never going to be able to point to climate change as the sole cause of a natural disaster. This film captures that ambiguity factually while simultaneously showing the audience that climate change was a factor and that we must act before these devastating events continue to get worse and affect more people.

Something that struck me as I watched "Fire in Paradise" was how vehement the authorities were in their blame towards PG&E. While I agree that the company's actions were disappointing, a massive safety hazard, and were the direct cause of this disaster, I think that part of the reason they felt so upset about it was because of their own failures in preventing it, and how some of these failures could not be fixed. Some of these failures are obvious and direct, such as the inefficient evacuation alert system and a plan made for fires that were less major, but others are indirect and wider. I think most (if not all) people in the United States (and other high-GHG emitting nations) participated in the failures that caused this fire to be so disastrous. We, and the generations prior to us, caused the climate change that created the intense conditions for the fire to flourish. On top of this, the US government has also failed the people of Paradise and victims of other fires caused by PG&E. Yes, the corporation is corrupt, and the disaster they have caused a huge fault of their own, but this corruption stems from the freedom corporations have in the United States. Under our current system, we allow corrupt companies to flourish for the sake of economic "freedom" at the cost of our environment, our rights, and our safety. This is the same system that allowed the causes leading up to the climate crisis to unfold in the first place.  
<br><br>

I agree that PG&E's actions are a direct cause of the destruction in this fire, but I also feel that they are only one small part of a larger problem. Under our current government that values corporations over people and economic gain over environmental preservation, we cannot shift the blame onto a single company and expect that to solve the issue. We must rethink and rebuild our political and economic systems, as well as our individual values as a nation that caused us to vote in the people who allowed destructive policy that focuses more on monetary gain than the value of a life.

Watching Fire in Paradise was truly disheartening to watch. I think more documentaries about the disasters and consequences of climate change that have directly impacted our own communities for us to witness are so powerful. The amount of pathos that the viewer perceives watching the victims experience this wildfire was immense. In addition, we saw this as they were experiencing it through their eyes, which makes it all the more powerful. 
<br><br>

Something I found interesting was comparing the interviews/testimonies of the victims and the dispatchers/first responders. You feel so much empathy and pain for the victims, but you want to be upset with the dispatchers for not alarming the community early enough. But, you see these dispatchers grappling with the ideas of what if, what if they did alarm the community earlier and I honestly feel sympathy for them too because in that moment of the fire, they felt completely out of control for people who are supposed to respond to these types of emergency. I don’t blame any of these people for not being fully prepared because the new conditions of this disaster was unimaginable. It doesn’t seem fair to put everyone in emergency mode and spend their lives preparing for these disasters that are easily preventable. It’s less work to change our lifestyles to prevent rather than retroactively react. Why invest tens of millions of dollars on roads that are only temporary preventative measures when we can use that money to prevent the root cause -- climate change. This is just truly just sad to witness these people so out of power. Lastly, I’d like to end this comment by commending Joe Kennedy who was a true hero in this fire.

After watching “Fire in Paradise” I was left feeling empty. The devastation that occurred was not done justice in the news that followed. I was shocked at the lives that were lost and the homes that were burnt. I think it’s a wake up call for all of us that climate change affects everyone, not just those far away. Living in Southern California, these wildfires hit close to home. My heart broke when hearing about how people were separated from their families and how it so much of it occurred because of the widespread unpreparedness. Knowing that the alert evacuation system wasn’t used that day and that the electricity wasn’t shut off, only adds to the tragedy. I think this is a wakeup call to communities across America, serving as a reminder that we must be more prepared and take every fire seriously. 
<br><br>

Looking at this from an environmental perspective, this fire should call attention to climate change. With a mixture of heavy winds and no rain, the environment made the conditions perfect for a wildfire. The fact that it spread 7.5 miles in 1.5 hours with winds of over 100 mph is alarming. Hearing that out of the 20 largest fires in California, 15 have happened in the 21st century is frustrating as a young adult. We must make changes in how we act politically, voicing our opinions in local and state government. It definitely moved me to want to speak out more and make a difference so future generations don’t have to deal with this.

I feel the same way. This documentary was very alerting and it was very hard to watch and hear what all the people interviewed had to go through. The hospital scene was very heartbreaking, especially hearing that some people had to evacuate right out of surgery. The embers flying around made it even more horrid. You could honestly hear the fear and pain in the people being interviewed's voices when they explained what they had to go through and do. 
<br><br>
This definitely is a wake up call. It teaches us that things could escalate really quickly and that people may not even get notified about it. And like you mentioned, it also could be a call for the urgency of the changes needed to be made.

After watching "Fire in Paradise," I'm speechless and shocked by the frontline of a devastating fire. This film reminds me of the wildfire that happened last year around Santa Barbara. Even though we were not affected as much as others, we still were able to smell the smoke and see the fire from a great distance. In the film, seeing people running on the streets or trapping in the car to run away from fire, I'm pathetic about their situations. Also, knowing the fact that this expanded fire disaster was manageable at first, I'm irritated by the inactions and irresponsibility of PG&E Corporation. The fire started beneath a high-voltage electricity tower that the power line was warned to be too old because of that failure of one piece of equipment burnt down an entire Paradise town. Based on the tracing of fire footprints, human-caused climate change has doubled wildfire since 1984, where summer is warmer, and drought is more severe. Due to the high winds and weather conditions, the fire spread unbelievable fast, which took only four hours to destroy paradise. Fifty thousand people managed to escape; however, those who did not take seriously and trapped in the car died. 
<br><br>


I can not imagine how people suffer in the fire and have no other way to evacuate. The ashes, flame, smoke, and everything can unexpectedly destroy us. When this kind of situation happens, the limitations of sources, access, and time risk out life, which switches into a position of luck. My reaction towards the film is that we have to act now to prevent further destructive fire. If we could limit the amount of emission we produce, at least we can have somehow a better situation than this. The fire may be manageable, and we can prevent the many other non-human caused wildfires. I wish people as a community could do something.

While watching the film “Fire in Paradise” I couldn’t help but feel heartbroken and devastated as I watched people struggle to escape the town of Paradise. Hearing the 911 dispatch calls and knowing some people might have not made it out of their homes for being trapped was horrific. Seeing the traffic that resulted from people fleeing all that the same time caused me to feel anxious in that it made me think about, what would I have done being put in that situation. Although I knew about the fire and had seen photos on the internet, I had not seen the intensity of it through videos or how difficult it was to evacuate. What I liked about this film was that, rather than laying out the facts of climate change, this film shows a consequence that resulted from global warming and how it affects our lives. 
<br><br>

As temperatures continue to increase and climates only get drier, fires are becoming more intense and severe. Fires are growing faster than anticipated as a result of climate change. Not only does it impact humans, but many species are forced out of their habitats and are dying as a result. As we are currently seeing in Australia, an estimated 1 billion species are said to have died from the wildfires taking place. If trends continue, fires are only expected to get worse.
<br><br>

Living in California, it's upsetting seeing the number of wildfires that take place in our state and how close to home they can be for many of us. When the Cave fire took place in Santa Barbara no one knew how severe the fire was going to be. Even though many were calm in that they knew the fire posed no threat to their homes, many families were still forced to evacuate not having many places to go. It really is heartbreaking seeing how life-threatening these events really are and how they are only expected to become worse in the future.

I totally agree with your comment. Those 911 calls were horrific and devastating. Just to hear those people o the phone broke my heart. I cannot possibly imagine what 911 workers had to go through when they heard these people suffering. California is experiencing fires at a larger scale and with an increase on distribution. We have to act now and help mitigate the problems that climate crisis is bringing upon us. We have the choice to reduce such natural disasters for a brighter future or we can choose to do nothing and hope that these disasters won't grow. It seems to me that we are at danger in any part of the world and that horrifies me. We are not longer safe...

<br><hr>
I agree. This film really hits home about the effects of climate change through the tangible consequences that we have already experienced, rather than what some might consider future "speculation." The idea that some people couldn't escape the fire puts into perspective that climate change is bearing its effects now, and it is heartbreaking. It is not something we can ignore, because people are dying.
<br><br>

 The film did a great job of making the viewer understand the power that the changing earth has, and I believe this is a key to getting people to stop denying climate change. I believe the tangible results are what may convert climate change deniers. In class, someone brought up the fact that Paradise was a more conservative town that was more likely to house climate deniers. I believe that after this event, some peoples minds must have changed. I also believe that the fact that one billion species in Australia have died from the wildfires will shock people into action. I think that people are more inclined to act if there are tangible results. Many people realize these life threatening events are due to the changing climate, and many people understand that these events will only get worse. Now, it is time for people to act, to preserve our future. Now that we have seen what can result from climate change, it is time to act.

<br><hr>
I feel the same way that you do watching everyone in Paradise being forced to leave their homes and not knowing what their futures held in store for them. "Fire in Paradise" does a good job exemplifying the magnitude of the dangers caused by extreme weather, and depicts the emotional horrors people had to go through. When the Thomas Fire occurred my first year at UCSB, school was cancelled early and everyone rushed to make it back home or just out of the area towards safety. Although campus was relatively safe compared to other neighborhoods in the county, I still remember the ash rains and the feeling that the fire signified that climate change was finally here in our own backyard. Even though the Camp Fire shown in the film was started by PG&E, this does not mean that climate change had nothing to do with it. The extreme winds were what caused the fire to spread at the velocity and magnitude that it did,  and the area was already very abnormally dry. With fires expecting to become more commonplace in California, it is imperative that we are prepared for them and know how to combat them.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with this comment; I too felt heartbroken at witnessing the fear and panic of the individuals who were impacted by the fire. I have no idea what I would do in a situation such as this, I don’t think anyone could possibly know until it happens. 
<br><br>

I live in California as well and while my home has never been directly impacted by a wildfire, I have felt some of the effects of these natural disasters. The smoke where I live got so intense during the fire in Paradise that the sun looked red, it was abnormally dark, and we couldn’t go outside without wearing a mask. School had to be cancelled for a few days because the air quality was so dangerous. Large fires such as these affect many people, and if they start to happen more frequently due to climate change, I cant even imagine how terrifying of an impact it would have on millions of people. 
<br><br>

I know that when these disasters happen we always feel pity for those directly affected, but we never ponder the fact that we will likely be affected as well. We never think about the increasing dangers that we are at risk of facing because of climate change. In California, if the temperatures continue to increase, we will all be at a great risk of experiencing a fire such as the Camp Fire. It is important to realize that this issue pertains to all of us, not just those in Paradise or other small towns. We must use these disasters as reasons to respond to climate change.
<br><hr>
This film really changed my perspective on the way I view California. For most of my life, I have not lived in a place that was really affected by these fires and only ever heard of the biggest ones. On news channels, the main facts that were relayed were how many injured or affected and the vastness of the fires, but to me, someone living many miles away, these facts had little to no impact on my day to day life. 

<br><br>

The consequences that you spoke of were the most significant aspects of “Fire In Paradise”. The scenes of the 911 phone calls and traffic scenes of people trying to flee the area were all incredibly eye-opening and show that the consequences of climate change are real, not just words written on paper to alarm us. The film used this method of exposing the consequences of our actions to incite feelings of remorse. In many of our lectures, we spoke about how we continue to add to the climate crisis because we are not directly seeing the consequences of our actions, but these film makers are using their platform to make us address those excuses. We can no longer deny the climate crisis because we were shown an hours worth of footage of the destruction we have contributed to.

<br><hr>

What really surprised me the most about the documentary was the ending where PG&E denies that the Paradise fire occurred primarily due to their faulty electricity lines. The fire they indirectly caused was the most destructive fire seen in Californian history and took the lives of many hardworking people. I simply could not believe that after all the damages they have caused, PG&E is not mature enough to step up and admit its own faults. The company has blood on its hands and constantly abuses its power as a corporation to get away with the legal consequences of committing such careless acts. This documentary emphasizes that with the fire-season now being all-year-round, there cannot be faulty equipment out near vegetation that is hazardous.

<br><br>

As Veronica also points out, since we all reside in California, this issue is affecting us, our relatives, and our friends directly at hand. With Santa Barbara's average temperature rising 2.3 degrees Celcius since pre-industrial times we are not safe from a devastating wildfire similar to the one in Paradise. It's really hard to believe that for so many years global warming was such a distant issue that has now become a reality in our backyards. We are not that far away from being the same people shown in the documentary helplessly calling out for help as their entire home is engulfed in flames. The documentary did an amazing job of providing visual images of the fire because they truly show how catastrophically damaging it was. It serves as a warning for other people living in California that if climate change is not taken care of, the same destruction they have seen in the documentary will suddenly arrive at their doorstep in the near future.


<br><hr>
As a child that loved to help anywhere that I was able, I considered being a 911 operator to help save lives. It's the phone calls like these ones that make me horrified that the deaths of lives could be on my shoulders. I would not know how to function after having to hang up on someone you lost then knowing you have to answer hundreds of more calls dealing with the same thing. I truly admire 911 responders and their service to this country.

<br><hr>
I completely agree. This film hit home for a lot of us compared to any other film regarding global warming. To actually see footage from the fire and to hear the distressed residents of Paradise sent chills down my spine. To see such a devastating disaster occur and to realize that climate change was the one to blame is really frightening. 
 <br><br>

An estimated 1 billion species being killed in the Australian wildfires is incredibly surprising. It’s hard to think that fires not only decimate a huge plot of land but also significantly decrease the biodiversity in an area. It’s almost like the domino effect or a positive feedback loop with these climate change disasters, one disaster unfolds tens of thousands of other small but significant changes, which brings about more and more disasters as time passes.
<br><hr>
While I did not experience the Paradise Fires, I did have to deal with the Tubbs Fire in Napa County that was going on at the same time, and I can say it is a stressful and scary situation. For days our house had no power, and in order to get any cell service in our area at least, you had to drive all the way across town. While our house was not evacuated, you always have to be prepared. As we saw in the Paradise documentary, fires are unpredictable due to winds shifting. There was ash falling for days, air was dense and uncomfortable to breathe, the sun burn bright orange and red from the smoke, and driving at night was incredibly difficult due to no street lights from the power outages and from the dense smoke. I watched the fire literally coming down the ridge line for hours from Skyline Park burning all the dead grass and vegetation at my friends house. Luckily the winds shifted that part away from the houses around there, and no embers sparked anything closer in the neighborhoods. We did have fires all around us, but even so, I can’t even imagine what those in Paradise experienced even after dealing with what I did with the Tubbs Fire. 
 <br><br>

Recently our house was under mandatory evacuation due to the Cave fires as well. That one we could also watch come down the ridge from our home. We had multiple police officers and sheriffs up and down going house to house telling everyone to start packing as we watched the orange glow from behind a nearby ridge. Having to make decisions on what to bring with you and leave behind is difficult, but you always have to prioritize your own safety over belongings. Material things can be replaced, your life cannot. We, along with others on our street, did decide to stay after our cars were packed (as we really had no good place to go), but we stayed up all night watching the fire from our driveway and keeping up to date on the news.
 <br><br>

Overall I feel the same as you. Just heartbreak for all those in Paradise who lost their homes, dealt with extreme panic, and ultimately lost their homes and lives due to the fires. And heartbreak for those in Australia as well. It is scary how devastating these fires are, and how unpredictable they can be.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that we have to take action now and do something in order to prevent our generation and future generations from suffering. No one is safe and places all over the world will experience the consequences of climate change.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with all of your points- watching this documentary really made me think about what I would do if I was put in the situation of having to deal first-hand with fires. My mom always tells me that when I get into situations that are life and death, I panic. This is completely true and this makes me even more fearful, especially because of the frequency of the fires in SB and the surrounding areas. I also agree that watching the film was completely heartbreaking. The thought of hearing people's last moments on earth is horrible. Especially over something that is accelerated by climate change- which we, as a country, are doing nothing to change. I loved that this film gave a face to the victims of the fire- it really put it into perspective just how serious this situation is. Overall, the film made me scared to say the least. In my opinion, I believe it is too late for us to reverse climate change and watching films like this reinforces my opinion.
<br><hr>

Thank you for opening up and sharing your experiences! I could not imagine how difficult it must have been for you and your family.  If we as a generation don't act now, it will only get worse.
<br><hr>
I share your feelings of devastation having watched this documentary. Knowing that these fires were so close in proximity to campus, I also thought about what I would have done if I had been in the center of the chaos or if it had been my friends or family in that situation. This film also really opened my eyes to the severity of these fires, and shows me how little I knew and understood about events that took place in the county I reside in. I agree that this film effectively demonstrated the real and raw consequences of climate change and I think it is important for depictions like those that were included in the film to spread awareness to those who are lucky enough to have not experienced such unfortunate events. As someone who was born in raised in California, I do believe we should all be alarmed as to how life-threatening and real these effects of climate change can be in our lifetime.
<br><hr>
This film really did an amazing job of placing the audience in the shoes of the residents. It is, for the lack of a better word, awful for sure seeing what these people had to live through; being stuck in traffic as you watch the whole world burn around you, running through flames and embers for a last hope of surviving, answering and listening to phone calls of frightened people knowing damn well you can’t do anything but the only comfort you can offer is staying on the line and listen to them die, seeing these law enforcement/first responders feel so powerless and try to take charge is haunting. Makes you realize how small and vulnerable our worlds really are and how fucked we will be if this happens to us. 
 <br><br>
Can we talk about the Paris Agreement for a sec. This plan was made back in 2015 and signed in 2016 and we are just now we are seeing that no one truly kept their promises because the rising numbers in temperature show different and the amount of countries actually meeting their goals is so low.This comes to no shocker, when there wasn’t even anything written on the document about how this agreement would be enforced, essentially no one was there to make sure everyone was keeping their word, does this remind y'all about the Articles of Confederation or just me?
 <br><br>
Can we talk about how close the fire was to campus back in November? Yes, it was later stated it posed no threat but the fire in Paradise proves that prevention for even the unimaginable is still the best thing you could do. Does anyone know what the protocol for a situation like this? If the fire were to have spread into campus do y'all know what we were supposed to do? If we are supposed to evacuate, at least in my case, with what car? Am I supposed to bike my ass to the train station and dip? I looked it up and UCSB has this Emergency and Safety manual here https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/resources/emergency/. Basically it did not go into very much detail but it’s up to you to evacuate and find safety, lol okay then.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with the way you feel. Although I was aware of the consequences, such as fires, that are intensified due to climate change, this film made me feel emotions that made me realize how serious this issue is. Hearing the voices of real victims on those 911 calls was extremely sad and their fear made me even more worried about the negative outcomes caused by global warming. I also think that it is frightening to know that so many animals had to suffer and will continue to suffer, as a result of this issue caused by humans. Not to mention, so many of these fires occur in California, which is extremely worrisome as it is my home. This film did a good job at expressing the dangers that can arise and will continue to arise if this issue is not stopped. I agree that these events people experienced are heartbreaking, and I hope that everyone can learn from this and help prevent future generations from suffering as well.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you said about not fully understanding the intensity of this fire before I watched the documentary. I remember hearing on the news and by word of mouth that a town had been completely incinerated, many people simply remarking that they thought it was ironic that the town was called "Paradise" when it turned out to not be one. After seeing the footage from this documentary however, I was truly horrified, and honestly appalled that so many people I know had spoken of the fire so casually.
 <br><br>

The pathos used in this film through the personal accounts and stories was extremely effective in revealing the gravity of the situation. Hearing the 911 call recordings and the stories of lost family members was absolutely heartbreaking. Just seeing the footage of the fire was incredibly stressful and brought up a serious emotional response as I watched. Like you said, the thought of this happening, and so close to home, was extremely upsetting. I can't imagine what it would be like to go through a situation like this, and the fact that these massive, destructive fires are becoming increasingly common in today's world is truly devastating.

The film started off pretty ominous. It had the type of introduction that would give anyone the chills. The film started off with the ignition of the Camp Fire. As the film progressed, so did the size and severity of the fire. It certainly gives the viewer a sense of how destructive and powerful this catastrophic event really was. It really shows its true power, and to be honest, it was quite terrifying. There were so many factors that played a role in the ignition, spreading, and destruction of the fire. Taking into account that climate change was already projecting its effect on the land, specifically during the dry season, making it more prone to natural wildfires. PG&E, America’s largest electricity company, was blamed for the start of the fire. Though PG&E certainly played a huge role in the destruction of the town, I do believe that it isn’t entirely their fault, at least for the progression of the fire. During the film, they tried to make it very clear that the town was advised that everything would be ok and that the fire opposed no threat on the town. What I’m trying to get to is that one of the main things I believe played a bigger role in this fire was the alerting and evacuation systems. If the town had had a better evacuation plan and alerting system, I can honestly say that no lives would have been lost that day. While the people that called 911 were terrified about what was occuring, the 911 operator claimed that everything was going to be okay, not knowing what monstrosity was coming their way. By the time the evacuation alerts went out, it was already too late. Since the fire was spreading so rapidly, firefighters didn’t have the chance to attempt to put out the fire, but immediately had to go into “rescue mode” because so many lives were already at stake. Due to this, firefighters weren’t able to obtain much intel on the fire to get out to the public. 
  <br><br>
The reason why climate change, or should I say “human-caused climate change”, plays a crucial role in the cause of the fire is because it is said that as the years went by, the season got longer, hotter, drier, and less humid. Due to this artificial phenomenon, wildfires doubled since 1984 in the Western U.S.. The weather the day of the fire also played a major role in the destruction of the town. If it weren’t for the weather, there most-likely wouldn’t have been 100mph winds pushing ember sideways, allowing the fire to spread rapidly, and disabling the use of air support. As you can tell, everything played some sort of role in the destruction of Paradise, some of which we could and could not have prevented. In conclusion, I don’t believe any factor should have taken most of the blame for the fire, but they all should be acknowledged in every aspect to find out what they could have done better to prevent or, if not that, at least reduce the degree at which the fire’s destruction had on the town.

The most important yet disheartening parts of “Fire in Paradise” were the individual stories of those affected by this disaster. I’ve noticed in the face of the climate crisis it’s easy to become somewhat morally disconnected. Climate change is such a massive and wide-reaching issue that it’s difficult to personally connect to the ruin it is causing in the lives of many. This movie offers heart-wrenching stories of how people have lost loved ones and nearly died themselves in a disaster that was worsened by climate change. I think more coverage of stories like these would inspire more people to take action. Rather than broadly hearing that climate change is affecting the world, people must hear that climate change is directly affecting these individuals in this area. It personalizes the issue. 
  <br><br>

The other striking part of this film was the end, which illuminated how these fires in our state will likely keep getting worse as the century progresses. I and so many of my friends want to live in California for the rest of our lives. We want to base our careers here and raise our families here. It’s disheartening to know that a crisis that was not started by my peers is likely going to affect the future we have envisioned for ourselves. Yes, it is our responsibility to do something about it, but it does feel unfair that the generation before us did not have to fear a global crisis of this magnitude affecting the rest of their lives. As Ken taught us, the fires currently burning in Australia are proof that climate change is worsening these natural disasters, as this documentary predicted. This whole issue makes the future for my generation seem so uncertain. We have yet to see what natural disasters will happen and how they will affect our lives. My hope is that it doesn’t take too many more for our state, country, and world to take serious action.

I love how you brought up this point. Seeing the climate crisis be broadcasted on the news and plastered all over social media can sometimes make it feel like it's taking place in a distant reality through a screen. I love how Ken described one of the effects of the film on its viewers: it "puts a human face to the climate crisis". I think the moral disconnection you mentioned can occur in bystanders due to a variety of factors (physical distance, ignoring the pain that comes by acknowledging disasters, etc.), but listening to stories of those affected allows those who haven't been affected to gain a new, valid perspective. It gives those people a reason to care. Overall, this film functions to make the climate crisis tangible, and that is so utterly important.

Watching "Fire in Paradise" was heartbreaking, it brought literal tears to my eyes. It seemed almost like a horror movie, not ever like an environmental documentary about the effects of climate change. People's lives were destroyed and families torn apart. How soon before the next largest wildfire wipes through UCSB, destroying everything we know and hold dear? Hearing the countless stories of lost loved ones, or the mournful 911 calls that rained in early that morning only to be met with false information cementing them in harm's direction. Two things were highlighted to me while watching this movie; firstly, that major contributors to this crisis like big power and oil don't care about the consequences that can come from these actions, something mentioned in both the movie and in many of the comments are he idea of "if it isn't broken, don't fix it), well the Earth is broken and we have to act to fix it. The second being that the conditions that gave way to such optimal burning potential were caused by a lack of rainfall due to irregular patterns of rainfall in the past century. All the evidence is there, and Ken in you're reading this, we're convinced and we're ready to hear how to help.

In regards to you're comment regarding big power and oil companies failing to care about the consequences of their actions, I agree. I find it rather disheartening that we live in a society fueled more strongly by the concept of wealth, than empathy for those around us. A fact mentioned in the video even stated that the average age of the PG&E power line towers was 68 years old, and an outside contractor found that the average life span before needed replacement should be 65 years old. Of course, the"don't fix it until it's broken" argument makes sense in terms of short term economics,  but it is truly the unwillingness to take preemptive action when it comes to making equipment safe for the current environment that makes me sick. From my understanding these large companies have plenty of power and money to put into environmental research and reclamation, and yet they are the ones who contribute the least while often being the ones who contribute the most to the climate crisis, which just seems utterly ironic to me. Finally, I also felt the similar feelings of shock and horror as you and thought it was scary to contemplate the idea of no plan ever truly preparing you for the wrath that mother nature can, and as we are seeing, will ensue. It is true that the evidence for climate change is here and I agree that we are ready to hear how to help.

The documentary "Fire in Paradise" affected me more than I thought it would. It almost seemed like a fictional movie and I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this was a real town that burned to the ground in such a short amount of time. What shocked me the most was how quickly the fire had spread to Paradise and was threatening the lives of every inhabitant. I couldn't believe it when I heard that many residents hadn't even received an evacuation order and didn't know the severity of the situation. The story of the police officer being on the phone with a woman trapped inside her house almost brought me to tears. I can't even imagine what it must feel like talking to somebody on the phone who is literally about to burn alive, and then, having to hang up on her after realizing she had died. The same goes for the woman who talked about being forced to leave her mother behind since she was refusing to evacuate. For whatever reason, this made me think about whether I would leave my house without my mother in the car seat next to me. Not that I blame the woman in the documentary in any way - it is simply impossible to imagine what you would do in a situation like that without ever being in it. 

  <br><br>

I know that the documentary was kind of hinting at the fact that the police officers could have issued an evacuation a lot sooner - and possibly saved the lives of some people. However, I think that rather than trying to put the blame on the police for not warning the public soon enough, or on the fire stations for not immediately trying to extinguish the flames, we should appreciate how much those people do for their community in the first place. I couldn't even imagine being a firefighter and risking my own life to save complete strangers, so before we judge them for "not doing enough", we should try to put ourselves in their shoes. Imagine all the guilt they probably already feel for what happened to their town. One of the police officers even mentioned how devastating it was to watch his beloved hometown burn to the ground and not being able to do anything about it. I am sure that they did everything in their power to help save as many people as possible. I believe that firefighters and police officers that are put in such unimaginable and horrific situations deserve so much admiration and gratitude. 
  <br><br>
Overall, the documentary truly showed the devastations of the Camp Fire - and any fire of this magnitude, for that matter. Hearing stories of the victims deeply moved me and I will definitely think of wildfires differently now.

As suggested by the title " Fire in Paradise,” this film talks about the terrible consequences behind a single equipment failure of PG&E. At the beginning of the movie, it shows us a paradise, a place where humans, wildlife, and nature can co-exist. However, as the weather grows dryer and becoming windier. The almost movie like disaster happened and left this city in chaos. I felt sorry for the residents living there. When the fire first broke out, they have never imagined that their home will have been destroyed. Although they tried to evacuate from the city, some people are trapper on the way. Looking at the film, the city is like an inferno in the human world. From equipment failure to a disastrous wildfire, the situation was getting uncontrollable within an hour. Sadly, humans still haven’t learned from their mistakes and strive to protect the environment. The bushfires in Australia that happen since September 2019 have not yet put out. Form news and social media, we can see pictures of burned koalas, severe air pollution, and local residents losing their homes. The consequences are catastrophic. Not just humans are influenced. Until 7 January 2020, 480 million animals were either burnt to death or deprived of habitat and food. It will take hundreds of years to recover from the destruction of ecosystems. With these events in mind, I hope we can make a difference by taking action right now!

After watching “Fire in Paradise,” I felt heartbroken as well as frustrated with the issue of the climate crisis. Having grown up in California, I have always been aware of the everlasting drought and threats of wildfires, however I had never researched or learned about wildfires in detail. This film introduced me to the first hand experiences of those who were directly affected by the fires, and helped me visualize and grasp the destruction that occurred. Like Ken said, this documentary “puts a human face on the climate crisis,” and bridges the disconnect between the people of focus in the film, and the viewers. I think that the structure of the film is very interesting because it utilizes various forms of evidence and combines live footage, clips of fire progression, and interviews to educate its viewers and show them the reality of wildfires. Although the film didn’t focus on climate change, I think that it shows its audience how drastically climate change is affecting the world and lives within it. Because of global warming, many areas around the world have become dry, which causes a rise in the probability of a fire occurring. It is sad that wildfires are becoming more common throughout the world, but this film makes climate change personal for its viewers and gives its audience a look into the experiences of those directly affected by wildfires.

I would agree that this documentary in particular was very personal. Like you said, growing up in California, we are used to seeing these fires and hear the facts about them. What really hit a nerve was the stories behind the facts. The daughter losing her mother, the grand daughter losing her grandfather, the wife who felt like she was going to die and never see her family again; these stories added another layer of tragedy to what happened. I believe by educating the viewers on what happened and, as you said, by “putting faces on the climate crisis,” we are the most effective. We can talk about stats all we want and the percentages, but until we hear of the tragedy, we have nothing to relate to and really feel the gravity of the fact that are planet is undergoing severe and fatal changes. It really does bridge the disconnect because it makes people think about if that was their family or what if they were in that situation. 
<br><br>
To add, I feel like this documentary did a good job of making us angry as well. To learn how PG&E KNEW that their equipment was faulty and didn’t do anything to prevent it is disgusting. It should not be just taken as a tale that fires start because climate change makes everything drying, it should also be a tale about how companies need to be held responsible for preserving the environment. Company greed has led to them putting the environment second which is the reason the Paradise fire happened. All and all, I believe the documentary was effective in getting a response from the viewer, I only hope that it causes people to look for a solution instead of a quick prayer and moving on.


<br><hr>
The documentary "Fire in Paradise" remind me of the fire last quarter. It was the first time I came to CA as well as my first time experienced such terrible fire. I used to heard nature disaster like this on TV and not really felt something. I think it is because I know it won't happen aroud my living area. However, when the I saw the fire on the mountain near me is soaring, the fear and scare are so real since I feel my life is threatened.
<br><br>

For these people in the documentary suffered much more than me. I was not physically hurt but many of them lost their  families and friends. Putting myself in their perspectives, I can fully imagine how much pain it would be. Annoyingly, while some suffer and carry the consequence of climate change, companies like PG&E is actually exacerbating this terrible condition without getting any punishment.
<br><br>

I agree that this documentant push people to face the harsh truth. It is so severe and critical that no one can escape. If we keep hiding behind the fact and don't stop daydreaming, the Earth will bring us more death in the near future.
<br><hr>
I absolutely agree with this comment. “Fire in Paradise” brought perspective to all the statistics when viewers see firsthand the fear, the damage, the loss of life. With the storyline well thought-out, viewers were taken through the emergency steps, through the failed 911 communications, through the harrowing stories filmed on iPhones. I see many people in the comments mad at the emergency response, but quite frankly, Paradise put a lot of effort into fire preparedness; many less prepared small towns would have not fared so well. This anger is misdirected. The fire started by PG&E in 40 degree weather, and spread with a rate unparalleled by that point, jumping a canyon that had never been jumped. The culprit is not the city management, indeed PG&E takes some of the blame, but these factors are all exacerbated primarily by anthropogenic climate change. 
<br><br>

It was absolutely heartbreaking to hear Ken’s statistic that the fires in Australia are exponentially worse than all of CA’s this century. To imagine the pain we just felt but on an unimaginable scale is simply beyond depressing. This is an issue that affects everywhere, coastal or not, and the pain of losing a house or a family member, not to mention the devastating loss of biodiversity is what people should be angry with.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you in the sense that the documentary didn’t focus very much on climate change, but with a consequence of climate change making it really impactful and like Ken stated “putting a face” to it. As I was watching the documentary, I couldn’t believe that the interviewees were talking through such a traumatic experience. Some lost their loved ones, and others almost died themselves. One of the scenes that was the hardest to watch was when the nurses and doctors brought their own cars to evacuate the patients in the hospital. Having to get out of surgery or being incredibly ill, and then being evacuated was something that was so heartbreaking for me to watch. What was the most frustrating to watch was that no matter how many resources the county had, they pretty much all failed, and they had no idea what to do. This is the new normal for places like California where planning for fires like this is a must but also might fail no matter all efforts. People lost their lives, their homes, etc. all because a company like PG&E refused to shut down power considering the heavy winds and old equipment that should have been replaced. They are known for many violations like this yet like one of the interviewees stated, you can’t put a company in jail. This is disgusting and heartless which would be an understatement. Watching this film was difficult, but it’s something everyone should be watching
<br><hr>
I agree. I think that for a lot of people, unless something directly affects or threatens their lives, they will not be spurred into action. This documentary really helps bring the threat of climate change right to the audience as well as those who are currently living in areas surrounding Paradise and makes its audience realize that we all face threat of climate change and that we are all vulnerable to the consequences of the rising global temperatures. This really made me realize that although climate change may not have directly caused the fires, it was a factor that caused the fire to grow and spread quickly. After finishing the film, I feel like in order for us to be able to keep our families and homes safe, we need to not only try to slow down climate change, but also update our responses and put in place newer regulations to reduce the likelihood of more natural disasters.
<br><hr>
I agree that, although I know wildfires are a very urgent threat to our climate, I've never seen its effects in such detail, as I did while watching the documentary "Fire in Paradise". Seeing the live footage from residents of Paradise as they fear for their lives, truly shows the danger and horrific outcomes of these disasters. This documentary definitely put a face to the climate crisis. As a California resident, I sat there shocked that I could peacefully be sitting in my home and, before I know it, a horrific fire could break loose and destroy my home/ town. That was a terrifying thought to face and put the climate crisis into a clear perspective for me. "Fire in Paradise" provided a raw look at what a natural disaster can do a community. The most prominent moment in the film was when one of the school teachers prayed that, if they died, they would die of smoke inhalation. The fact that these disasters led these innocent people to such a desperate mental state shows just how terrifying they really are. And, it made me think of all the wildlife that sadly burned and suffered. Watching this documentary opened my eyes to yet another way the climate crisis can wreak havoc on our Earth.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment because I too felt heartbroken and frustrated with the outcome of the Paradise fire and how the climate crisis is making wildfires worse. It was very saddening having to watch how the citizens of Paradise had to live through such a terrible event and know that fires of that magnitude are going to be the norm during California’s fire season which is especially scary since I am a California resident myself. The film, in general, was very informative, and the way they structured the film was excellent in making the audience hurt with the residents of Paradise and let the public know just how close to home these fires can be. A shocking detail brought up in the film was that most of the more devasting and largest fires have happened in the past decade. People need to know that the fires are how California is going to come in contact with the climate crisis this film is an excellent example of that and it is also good to note that fire similar to the Paradise fire could happen in any of our backyards and we need to do everything we can to change that.
<br><hr>
Similar to you, I too felt that it was difficult to watch this documentary. Often times you hear about these natural disasters, but never hear from or see the faces of the people it affects. I too am from California, and am aware of the ongoing drought we have, as well as the fires that we have encountered. I was actually at UCSB when the Thomas Fire happened, and we were forced to evacuate a few days before school ended. This documentary opened my eyes to how severe the conditions have become, and will continue to worsen with the intensity of climate change increasing. It showed me truly how quickly a wildfire can start in certain conditions, and these conditions are starting to become more common with the rise in temperature. The hot, dry weather in Paradise, along with the high wind velocity, allowed a spark from an electrical tower to spread into a completely chaotic wildfire. Within 45 minutes, it had spread to about 300 acres. Even more surprising, after about an hour or two, the rate the fire was spreading was about 80 football fields per minute. This fire that caused roughly 30,000 people to lose their homes and killed 85 people should be an eye opening catastrophe to the nonbelievers of climate change. Conditions are getting worse, and the window of time we have to reverse the effects is getting smaller.
<br><hr>
I also found the documentary’s format to be effective in connecting the film’s subjects to its viewers. I believe this was an important feature, since it shows natural disasters and climate change in a human lens rather a statistical one. Many statistics, no matter how shocking or urgent, do not have a lasting impact, or one that is lasting enough for people to act upon it. However, giving real life stories of victims, families, and first responders elicits another layer of emotion and therefore adds a new light to the issue that makes the climate crisis feel more personal. It is common for people to not take climate change seriously because they are apathetic about it. However, appealing to viewers’ emotions makes it difficult to feel indifferent towards the wildfires, especially because it occurred so close to people here rather than in other parts of the world that feel so removed.
<br><hr>
Before watching the film, I was unaware of the damage the fires in California had caused. I’m used to hurricanes, and fire has always been a foregin element that I had very little contact with. They did an amazing job at showing a first-hand experience of what it would feel like to be caught in a fire with no way out. I had never really thought of a situation in which I could get in my car and try to drive away from danger, and then just end up in the middle of it with nowhere to go. I was terrified for them. This film really put me in the shoes of those having to live with the reality that a fire could tear through their homes and destroy everything they’ve ever known. 
<br><br>


Its hard to understand a disaster this big as something that could have been prevented by people. Its almost too big to comprehend. Yet without serious reforms and a new movement to really understand your place in the world and how you can affect something as mundane as the weather, these fires will get worse. We can already see how rising temperatures have created perfect climates for fires in Australia, is there really any more evidence necessary?

<br><hr>
I agree with your statement. Living in California for the entirety of my life, I feel that the effects of climate change have always been known, but never acted upon. Despite being in a large drought, and the abundance of fires in recent months, people are still slow to act. They cling on to the perception that climate change can be dealt with later; this is far from the truth. "Fire in Paradise" shows that not only is this dilemma urgent, it may also have reached the irreversible stage. The idea that residents from nearby cities and counties have experienced so many evacuations draw great concern to the topic. The US has largely ignored the issue, as they could not witness the damage of climate change firsthand; before, only third world countries and foreign places were said to have been affected. Now that the fire is in America, a supposed world super power, the threat of the situation is realized.
<br><br>


The documentary brings to light the grim details of the truth of climate change. No longer can people see it as a faraway problem for others to deal with; not only are wildlife and habitats being affected, but now human life. Firefighters, families, and Californians are now taking the brunt of the effects, highlighting the need for radical change.

Fire in Paradise, a documentary, talks about the most destructive fire in California’s history. At the beginning of the movie, it narrates the beauty of life in the mountains, the birds in the woods and the stars in the night sky. Suddenly, a fire broke into people’s lives. This extremely serious fire was caused by PG & E's “negligence”, polices’ hesitation, and weather conditions. An old facility built by PG&E fell and caused the fire. The strong wind caused by climate change spread the fire at an unprecedented speed, which produced detrimental effects not only on the city but also on many families.

<br><br>

A fire often has a great impact on the environment, burning trees constantly release carbon dioxide, dust, and human-made goods will release toxic gases. Unfortunately, the fire in California exacerbated the deterioration of the environment. The film explains that the change of environment makes the fire uncontrollably, which looks like a cycle. How to break the cycle is to eliminate environmental degradation before the next more serious fire, which requires the efforts of all human beings.

<br><br>

One of the sentences in the documentary triggered my thinking, "People should be responsible for their own safety." When we are in a disaster, all we think is how to escape and how to survive, but after the tragedy, what should we do? Complaining about the stupid company? Complaining about the police? Everyone is responsible for the deterioration of the environment. Instead of blaming others, what if we calm down and think like this way. If we take buses to drive less, turn off lights when leaving to save power, and so on, would the situation, the fire, be different?

Coming from the island of Oahu, I was very unfamiliar with fires and their effects. At home we have hurricane season, but I had no idea there was such thing as wildfire season. After watching this documentary, I now fully understand the effects that fires have on entire communities and I felt so sorry for all the people of Paradise. It was devastating to watch these people have to abandon their homes knowing that they may never see it again. But, that was not even the biggest problem. Losing their homes was minor compared to losing their lives. Hearing the accounts from the woman from the hospital brought me to tears. Seeing the hospital workers carry out all of the patients and flee looked like a movie scene. Hearing how this woman told her husband that she might die and begged for him to reach her was very emotional and hard to watch. Another scene that was hard to watch was the account of a daughter losing her mom. Her mother was not alerted to evacuate and therefore perished in the fire. These events weren't scenes in a movie, but they were real life. If this fire and other fires that have been frequently sprouting up do not wake up our planet about climate change, I'm starting to think the day will come when climate change takes over, and only then will people wake up. By then it will be too late. We must take these fires, hurricanes, floods as signs. We must not ignore them, but in a way be grateful for them because they will help us screw our heads on tight and solve this issue before it gets much worse. On our little island it is like we are in our own little bubble. I feel so guilty that I had been so ignorant about the effects of fires. It was not until I came to UCSB that I learned about the dangers of climate change. Back home, we have more severe hurricanes, however I never learned in school the true reason as to why this was occurring. Now, I am aware of the issue and will try my best to spread the message to people back home, especially.

While watching Fire in Paradise, I realized that the fire itself could symbolize the climate crisis all together. In a way, we could look at it as a crystal ball. One of the dispatchers in the movie said that the people of Paradise unfortunately felt a false sense of security. They didn’t get what they needed: more and faster information. They didn't know anything was wrong until the fire was entering their backyards and they were trying to water it away. And when they finally decided to evacuate it was too late. About 50 to 60 years ago, the world was in that first stage: feeling a false sense of security. Nobody really knew about the climate crisis and nobody really cared. That is because nobody was really forcing the information on them. Now, in 2020, I feel as though the fires are finally encroaching on our communities. We see the smoke and the ashes and therefore we feel this sense of discomfort. Deep down, we know it's coming. By 2050, if we continue living the way we do, we will be in our backyards, trying to water the fire away. However, the fire will be too strong, it will be too late to evacuate, and our home -- Earth -- will be destroyed. 
<br><br>

"Of the 20 largest wildfires in California history, 15 took place in the 21st century."
<br><br>
"The fires burning in Australia are 4 times as big as the 15 largest wildfires in California history combined." These statistics are what stuck out to me the most. They paint a scary picture: a burning world. 
<br><br>

These fires are not just a result of the climate crisis, but also a force that promotes the phenomenon's progression. Fires caused by the climate crisis can be seen as part of a positive-feedback cycle. Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, temperatures rise, seasons become more extreme, fires erupt when the wind picks up, fires release more carbon dioxide, and the cycle continues. This cycle not only infiltrates the atmosphere, but also the oceans. Carbon dioxide is sequestered by the oceans. It turns into carbonic acid and wrecks the ocean. Carbon dioxide also causes acid rain. Earth, fire, water, and air -- the climate crisis affects everything.
<br><br>

One of the firefighters in the film said that “what happened on Pearson Road [in Paradise], [they] don’t train for. They don’t teach [them] how to move fully involved cars. They teach [them] how to avoid that.” These firefighters are taught to prevent detrimental events and save people from dangerous situations. They focus on preventative techniques. In the past, we could look at preventative techniques as helpful strategies to prevent impending disasters and death due to climate change. They would be the perfect plan A. However, there is nothing to prevent now. These disasters are already happening. We must ditch the preventative techniques and move on to plan B: actually saving our dying planet. 
<br><br>

The fire in Paradise was visible from space. The fire had burned through an entire town within five hours. People grew up in that town, went to school there, and made memories there. Now, it's all gone. Many childhoods were lost forever. I can't imagine the pain previous residents of Paradise must feel every time they think of a memory from their old homes. The memories might be sweet, but they will always have a burnt aftertaste. 
<br><br>

I used to think that no matter how many people leave my life and no matter how many things I lose, I will always have nature. I specifically find comfort in the sun and the moon, which come and go but are always there. However, I never realized until now that in order to find comfort in the sun and the moon, I would still have to be living on Earth. That is not guaranteed.
<br><br>

When the film stated that 85 people perished in the Camp fire and a majority was over 65 years old, I felt disheartened yet even more motivated to help make a change. Jordan Huff, who lost her grandfather in the fire, stated that when she and her dad drove back her grandfather's house in Paradise, everything was gone except for his wheelchair and a watering hose. He was fighting to save his house and his life. I hope we fight as hard as he did.
<br><br>

I am praying for Jordan Huff’s family and I hope her grandfather is resting well.

I agree with your idea that the Fire in Paradise and how it was handled could be compared to the climate crisis as a whole. I never thought of it this way, but I’m glad you brought it to all of our attention. I feel as though it could also be related to PG&E in this situation. It’s the same idea of people not seeing the immediate effects, so they want to push the limits more and more. PG&E did this when they knew that the towers were aging and that components might fail because of this aging, but they didn’t see any bad effects from the aging yet, so they kept pushing and pushing their limits until eventually the Fire in Paradise occurred.

I agree with you on your metaphor with a too little too late mentality when it comes to the climate crisis. I really do not think the blame lies with the fire fighters or emergency departments. Fire scientists know that these kind of threats are coming and try to prepare for them, but it’s impossible to be 100% prepared for everything. So any vestiges of guilt they feel or misplaced anger viewers might feel is just silly. However I am totally down to blame (possibly) negligent power companies. It’s the double edged sword of energy companies heavily contributing to the climate crisis and also (possibly) causing fires. 
 <br><br>
It was really weird seeing this film made for such a wide audience of non-Californians. It really makes you stop and think about how the world sees us, how they see the climate crsis, and how we look at the environmental tragedies all over the world. Do they feel for us like we do when we watch documentaries on the rain forest? Do they ignore our “go-fund me’s” like we do theirs? Do they pray for us like we pray for the coral reefs (if you’re into that sort of thing). How will we see this in the future. Will we become so emotionally and financially drained by reality that it won’t seem like individual disasters anymore, instead blurring into one big tragedy that’s bigger than we can comprehend? Should I notbe doingthis assignment at 4 am because I’m getting emotional over how amazing the earth is and how much we stand to lose in the climate crisis? Yeah probably??

This film is shocking to watch, because it uses reality, rather than figures and graphs, to show the consequences of a fire. It is heart-breaking to see the panic when people were surrounded by fire and didn’t know what to do. If I were to be put in a similar situation, I know that I would be as helpless as they were. What had happened was a major disaster, and there were several aspects that led to it. First of all, it was very clear that proper orders of evacuation were not given out, or not to everyone who should be informed. At the very beginning, when a huge amount of people started calling 911 to report the fire and smoke they had witnessed and to ask for instruction, no proper response was given, nor were the institutions informed about the real situation. Also, when people started to evacuate, there were some that did not get an evacuation order and thus did not react to save themselves. This was exactly what the video means when it says that “ultimately people had to be responsible for their own safety”. Moreover, the limitations of transportation made the situation worse. This is not to blame entirely on the government for the lack of fundings to widen the roads. Just as similar to the pollution problem, in order to carry out the plan with money, we probably need some regulations and supervision beyond the local government. Furthermore, there have been discussions around how PG&E should take responsibility of what has happened. In my opinion, PG&E was definitely a culprit, but it was the combined forces of people that pushed the situation to where it was--the office not sending order to all residents; the government not carrying out their plans (if any); the people not being aware that they were the best rescuers for themselves...

I thought that this documentary would just be similar to the other ones we have watched in class and in English 22, but watching Fire in Paradise brought a new perspective on wildfires and how the climate crisis is causing a detrimental impact both for human and non-human life. 

 <br><br>

The documentary was impactful in many ways, particularly in the sense it portrayed the wildfire as unprecedented and unexpected. Fire in Paradise explains how in the beginning, PG&E were thinking about turning off their system to reduce the risk of wildfire, but decided not to because the winds were apparently decreasing, so they did not expect any danger to arise. When the vegetation fire first occurred early in the morning, even the Chief and the people residing along the town of Paradise didn’t think much of the fire because the weather was cold and fires typically do not pass the mountains that separate Paradise and Concow. When emergency services initially received calls about the fire, they reassured the residents that the town of Paradise would be safe, and Cal Fire did not issue any mandatory evacuations. However, with the combination of high winds, high temperature, and the overall dry climate, the small vegetation wildlife became a large catastrophic issue. 
 <br><br>
It is honestly terrifying that the climate crisis is causing these natural disasters to worsen each time it occurs. As I was watching this documentary, I couldn’t believe that it actually occurred, and hearing all the testimonies of the victims were both heartbreaking and devastating. Many of the victims were stating how the fire caused absolute mayhem and chaos around the city, and some of them were forcefully separated from their family members and didn’t hear from them even after the fire. 
 <br><br>
Overall, Fire in Paradise truly illuminates how dangerous natural disasters are becoming year after year, and the biggest reason for this is the climate crisis. The Paradise fire was so destructive that it burned across 20,00 acres, and was even visible from space. If decisive action against the climate crisis doesn’t start now, then these disasters will only continue to occur.



</p><hr>


<p>
All I want to say is that everything is in a mess. It’s chaos. And every person and every living thing are suffering. Life is so vulnerable in front of major fire. It is a fire caused by electric power and it should be a manageable fire. But the reporter didn’t seriously look at the speed of the wind and the officials didn’t see the seriously at first. The evacuation plan didn’t work, the red code didn’t work, and no firefighters cannot take control of the fire. Everyone wants to live and they all drive cars and running away. Some people didn’t even have a chance to run and stuck in the house. 
 <br><br>




One thing that should be notified here is that there is no order and efficiency. Although local officials have made a
 <br><br>

“plan” for evacuation but it didn’t work. And the officials say that because the fire is unprecedented, so we cannot envision it happening. It cannot be a
reason. In the interviews, these officials are avoiding to answer some sharp questions and I see from the interview that they don’t acknowledge that they
need to take part in the responsibility of the major fire. They keep saying that we cannot make it because nobody can envision the fire. 
 <br><br>




One thing that should be notified here is that there is no order and efficiency. Although local officials have made a “plan” for evacuation but it didn’t work. Police and officials didn’t react quickly and inform locals of what was happening. There should be a better and multiple plans for evacuation and officials should value every event. Information is also important. Most people in Paradise didn’t receive a warning from offices and they cannot leave quickly then. With the latest information, organized rescues, and quicker reaction, the possibility of living can increase and more people can live through disasters.

Watching “Fire in Paradise” was completely mind blowing and heartbreaking. Seeing the complete devastation that it caused to an entire town was horrible. Although I was aware of the fire and that it was horrific, I was desensitized and saw it as a sad but distant issue. I had never seen all the graphics of the fire and just how bad it was. I can not fathom being in that position of being completely surrounded by fire and smoke with embers blowing on you. It gave me chills. What shocked me the most and what I couldn’t stop thinking about was the speed at which the fire travelled. The town had been destroyed within a few hours of ignition. Ken’s video brought up what I had been thinking about, which is if it had happened in the middle of the night when no one was awake to see it coming like the mudslides in Santa Barbara. The casualties would have been so much higher and it is truly terrifying that the fire could spread so fast and cause so much destruction in a short period of time. 
 <br><br>

It was scary to see how despite plans and preparation for emergencies, when it came down to it, they weren’t prepared for it to be at the magnitude that it was. And that is something we are going to have combat better as the natural disasters get worse and worse due to climate change. We are starting to face disasters and events unlike anything else we have experienced and we are not adapting or trying to be more prepared for it. The miscommunication between the first responders and civilians was truly heartbreaking as people were given information that could have cost them their lives, and for some people, it did. The systems we currently have in place are not enough to keep us safe and the Campfire was our first huge example of that. We need to do better and that starts with recognizing that there is an issue and that it is linked to climate change. 
 <br><br>

The documentary really opened my eyes to a disaster that is a very real threat to all of California, especially where I live- Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. The possibility of our livelihoods burning to the ground like the whole town of Paradise is terrifying yet it was a very good watch since I now actually recognize the magnitude of the issue and it left a lasting image in my mind.

I agree, this film was devastating to watch. To see how huge the fire grew and how it made day look like night was something I had never seen or heard of before. I also had heard about this fire, but had no idea the extent of it. I knew it was bad as well but never saw the horrible images of the smoke and the idea of being trapped in the traffic that the film showed. The idea that these fires keep happening is terrifying to me as well to feel like we could get trapped here. But instead of just being scared by it we need to inform everyone on this very real possibility so that they want to make lifestyle changes.
 <br><br>
Another thing Ken mentions is that the fires in Australia right now are 4 times bigger than the largest 15 wildfires combined. This really took me by surprise, a huge number I cannot even grasp. I think this is another example of the issues of fires and like you said we need to communicate and prepare as well as we can so that we do not lose lives in fires that may hit. I agree that we need to make sure systems are in place so that if a fire were to hit, we are ready.

After watching the film "Fire in Paradise," I am more aware of how dangerous wildfires are and their impact on the environment. I didn't know how fast wildfires spread and how many people were affected by them. While I had a basic understanding of the effects of wildfire, this film allowed me to grasp the true scope of the situation. Vegetation and homes are destroyed, displacing hundreds of people and leaving thousands without jobs. Hearing the stories of the people in the film made me feel sad for those affected by the wildfires, and it really opened my eyes to the situation. 
 <br><br>
Climate change is a huge contributor to the spread of wildfires. As global temperatures rise, wildfires become more frequent and intense. As the earth warms up, ice caps melt and the soil becomes more dry. This makes it easier for wildfires to spread very quickly, making them last longer and grow in size. Preventing wildfires starts when we accept that climate change is very real problem that needs to be solved immediately.

<p>

The film "Fire in Paradise" documents the tragic events that unfolded in the small town of Paradise, CA. Honestly, this movie educated me in demonstrating just how fast a fire can spread if there is little action taken. The situation in Paradise was extremely saddening as the public were left in the dark the whole time about the events of the fire. Additionally, the many stories of the victims of the fire really impacted me as I empathized for them in their confusion and worries. I couldn't help but notice how this one mother refused to leave her house despite the raging fires surrounding her town. This situation can parallel the mindsets of some people of today's society about climate change. The environment is slowly getting worse around them, and it is evident in the way that natural disasters are more common, sea levels are rising, and  temperatures are drastic, but still, some people decide to turn a blind eye and stay within the house of their own stubbornness, much like the woman in the documentary.

The documentary "Fire in Paradise"  publicizes the increasing commonality of natural disasters due to increased temperature in California. The Thomas fire was a huge wildfire affecting the Ventura and Santa Barbara county. During the film, one can recognize how deadly the Thomas fire was.  
 <br><br>
What was most compelling to me was when an expert in climate change stated the wildfire events were not unprecedented.  The fire was responsible for the death of 15 people and the destruction of more than 2000 residencies. At the current rate, we're going in temperature increases, communities in Ventura and Santa Barbara are now more than ever prone to catastrophes like this.  Despite this, we continue to demonstrate a lack of activism to fight the imminent disasters the global climate will cause. Watching children, parents and grandparents go through such terrifying events like this that can be prevented breaks my heart.

I come from a family of Cal Fire employees, my mom started her career as a firefighter for many years, and now is a Cal Fire dispatcher, and my step dad who is also a Cal Fire employee, so I come from a home with a lot of fire knowledge. Growing up in Northern California wildfires were something that I was used to hearing about but never in my own community, this changed my sophomore year of high school when the Butte Fire affected my own county, many friends were evacuated and we could see the flames from my balcony. Although the concept of wildfires have always been in my life, and knowing that my mom would probably be working a lot during the summer times have been a way of life for me. But with our climate changing rapidly California fire season in increasing in length, our state’s season for fires is stretching out to about the months of November and December. These fires are becoming bigger, faster, stronger, and even more unpredictable. Cal Fire employees are trained on how to control fires in specific areas, for example the Butte Fire in my hometown burned in a completely different way that Cal Fire was expecting and trained for; this is becoming the way fires act and this was also seen with the Paradise Fire. 
 <br><br>

This documentary we watch made me very emotional, it evicted a range of emotions from me, from sadness to anger. The fact that California has had 10 of the 20 most destructive fires in the past 4 years is shocking to me, and we still have people in the world who fail to acknowledge climate change as a culprit. How many innocent lives need to be lost, or towns being burned over, or people losing everything due to extreme weather for people to start making changes and realize we are destroying this planet, causing extreme consequences? These kinds of documentaries always makes me feel pessimistic, but there is still hope. Within the Cal Fire community they are starting to realize they need to hire more environmental scientists to help them battle these extreme wildfires and educate them. It only needs to start with one, and we cannot give up now, but try even harder to fix this problem that humans have created themselves.

This film, Fire in Paradise, was extremely sobering to watch. While in my mind, I am aware that climate change is a real threat, I often only think about it in terms of things that are going to happen in the future. This film reminded me that the dangerous and deadly effects of the warming Earth are happening right now, in my own state. 

 <br><br>

I remember when this fire occurred. I was a senior in high school in Walnut Creek, 160 miles away from Paradise. I remember hearing about it on the news, but it was far away so I believed that it would have no effect on me. However, the winds pushed the smoke from that fire so that the entire Bay Area was blanketed in smoke and ash. This was not our first encounter with poor air quality. The year before, a fire in the Napa Valley had produced so much smoke in my area that we had school canceled for two days. While in other places in the US, kids get snow days, we were used to smoke days. The smoke from the Paradise fire affected my life as an inconvenience by making it more difficult to breathe, canceling a concert, and pushing back a polo championship game. In the moment, I don’t think I fully grasped how bad the fire really was. Watching this film really put it all in perspective. The fire engulfed the entire town in less than three hours, traveling at the speed of 80 football fields a minute. Actually hearing people’s accounts of what happened that day was so devastating.
 <br><br>


The saddest part of this entire film was that it made me realize that fires like this one are most likely going to continue to happen. Just two months ago, there was another fire up near Richmond/Marin that caused PG&E to do mass blackouts in my hometown. My younger sister told me about how she had to go to class in the dark and how our home didn’t have power for three days. That means that in the past three years, at around the same time in late November, there has been a fire that affected where I live. And it will probably only get worse.

I find it interesting that you, along with so many of our peers (as I am reading through the comments) have experienced wildfires. Every year it seems as if we encounter wildfires that become more destructive and more frequent. Wildfires have become a new norm in our world (especially California). We all have our own wildfire story to tell, some unfortunately worse than others. 
 <br><br>

I really enjoyed the comment you made about "smoke days" being our "snow days". It's ironic because the world is starting to experience less and less "snow days" and more and more "smoke days" because of the climate crisis. 
 <br><br>

The fire in Paradise is incredibly destructive and the fact that it was the fault of corporate greed is disgusting. Did the live of the people did equate the amount saved? At what point does this stop? How many lives must be taken for corporations to start assigning values to human lives?
 <br><br>

 It's incredibly frightening how much large corporations have control over the entire world.


<br><hr>

I felt the same sobering feeling you described. I'm from norcal, near Sacramento, and we too felt the serious decrease in the quality of our air. I remember vividly getting ready for basketball practice after school with my teammates on the Thursday before our Thanksgiving , when we got an email from the school notifying us that school would be cancelled on Friday. Everyone cheered for our early start to Thanksgiving break. I don't believe that they would still cheer after watching this video. I'm guilty knowing that, while I didn't cheer, I was still relieved to know I was starting break early. I'm guilty for not putting our situation in proper context of knowing that the fire was a serious issue. 
 <br><br>

In a way, the situation I experienced is kind of a metaphor for Climate Change as a whole. While there was a fire burning, seriously impacting the lives of an entire city, just hours away a school was rejoicing at the extra day off. As Earth warms and the consequences  begin to show, affecting the lives of countless people, while on the same planet, people are rejoicing that they have another day.
 <br><br>

What's interesting to me is that my teammates aren't bad people. One of them was the nicest, most respectful person I know and still was relieved to not have school. We didn't know the fire was as destructive as it was, we had become used to the terrible air quality around that time of the year. It's almost like we are becoming desensitized to the fires, which is scary to think about. Until you actually see what is happening, we're never going to stop cheering for our extra day.

This film shows how extreme, personal, and life-threatening climate change can be. The bushfires in Australia are almost extinguished but the vegetation and animals that were destroyed, killed and forced to migrate will have major impacts on Australia's ecosystems. Once something terrible like this has occurred, the media swallows the topic and begins to broadcast. However, eventually people get tired of hearing the same things so it eventually fades away. After the historical Amazon fires, media quickly dropped coverage and information regarding Brazil's environmental losses was rarely discussed. These major weather events that can be directly related to climate change become quickly forgotten and thus, the lesson is never learned. Something in our society and media broadcasting needs to change before our choices over the past century will begin to change this planet forever.

This comment is spot on. I believe that the media should be more focused on covering the effects of these catastrophes caused by climate change after the event has occurred. The reason many people want to donate or help the cause is because of the relevance of the event, such as I have done in the past and then didn’t follow up to see what has occurred after. Yet, after that event has been covered for a little bit, the media will change course and talk about other topics leaving the problem to be dealt with by the people most affected by it, and not by the whole nation. This causes people to think of these events as typical and that all these events have been resolved. Overall, covering these topics more and how they relate to climate change could really alter people's views causing more people to take this situation seriously. The more people involved in reversing climate change, the better off the planet is and when news disregards these events and doesn’t follow up on them, people will forget the world needs as much help as it can get.

A documentary like Fire in Paradise takes an emotional approach to the climate crisis even more so than before by focusing on the people directly affected by the fires rather than the wide range of consequences as a result of what we’re doing to our planet. It’s the perfect film for anyone who doesn’t understand the severity of the climate crisis, or who don’t believe it exists at all. I got emotional during the hospital segment and seeing everyone work together to save patients and loading them up in their cars. It’s real footage, it isn’t a reenactment or acting. In a sense, it’s also a wake up call that this crisis is something very real and that it can happen to anyone despite wealth. I loved the emphasis the film puts on PGE towards the end and their history of violations, the sense that greedy corporations couldn’t care less about the environment if it sacrifices their profit. 
 <br><br>

I understood from the beginning why this documentary was picked for us to watch, bringing the climate crisis’ consequences to a smaller scale by focusing on this one disaster, and its aim to evoke emotion by capturing humanity in the midst of death. The devastation the film ends with, shots of burnt forest and remaining furniture, lingers with viewers.
 <br><br>

One of the most heartbreaking parts about the movie is when it takes a moment to unravel the perspectives of the 911 phone operators and the downfall of the evacuation protocol. Seeing all the cars stopped in traffic and the fire devouring the surrounding areas put me in a headspace that made me think how terrifying it must be just to see that there isn’t a way out.

I like that you pointed out how this documentary is taking on a more emotional approach to climate change because I’ve always believed that documentaries like this one are essential to getting people to really sit down and listen to why climate change is an issue. Some people are quick to deny the statistics and reports that scientists put out, but when they can actually see the impact it’s having on people’s lives, it changes their view. In a couple of lectures, Ken has brought up how we often push away the effects of climate change because they’re so “far away”. I thought about that a lot while watching because the whole time I was like “the effects are here and there’s real lives at risk because of them!” It makes me wonder just how much people will continue to deny the consequences or if they’ll continue until they’re the ones losing their homes.
 <br><br>

The entire film made me feel a range of sadness and frustration. Sadness was hitting me hard every time there was a scene such as the hospital one or the phone call from those four people stuck in the basement (especially that one). Then, the frustration came hard when I thought about PG&E’s irresponsibility and about how terrible the evacuation plan fell apart. Perhaps the most frustrating for me was the beginning where all those people were calling about the smoke and if they should evacuate but were told no. By the time they were finally notified, it was too late.
 <br><br>

I was in a terrified headspace too seeing the traffic. My anxiety was sky high watching that. I think I’m more afraid now because I live here now and I am at risk of being heavily affected by a brush fire.

<br><hr>
I agree that the most saddening part of the documentary, was the perspectives of the 911 operators because one operator expressed how she wished she could have done more which shows how she carried some guilt of the lives of people, yet it was not her fault. This tragic fire came unexpectedly and brought so much damage despite the fact that the town of Paradise had planned evacuation routes and alert text messages, but they were still unprepared for this fire. This also makes me think about how instead of planning ahead for future disasters we should be planning on what we should do to prevent it because we never really know how hard these natural disasters will hit because of climate change. This documentary overall evokes the emotions of the audience by showing the harsh truth about what happens when climate change isn’t taken seriously. The Paradise fire was very destructive, ruined many homes, and killed many people. During the film, I felt emotional several times because I was able to put myself in their shoes, and saw the damage that the fire did to the town of Paradise. Living in California where fires are very frequent, I was able to see the severity of fires and how fast they can spread which I wasn't aware of before.

<br><hr>
I agree, documentaries like these are vital to the other's understandings of how real and of how destructive the climate crisis is. It allows people to see the human aspect of what is happening rather than just a regurgitation of facts. The film was one that was very heavy and emotional as well as all encompassing and hard to take your eyes off of. The hospital scene was also the scene that inflicted the most emotions for me as well. The mixture panic and haste in their voices was extremely sad as they had to the best they could to evacuate medical patients in such a small amount of time. Not only that but, their feelings were easily conceivable because you could see how quickly the fire was moving and closing in upon them. 
 <br><br>

I could clearly remember the fire being covered on national television news channels and watching the coverage in awe. I couldn't even conceptualize how an entire town could be flattened by a wildfire. Then seeing the videos of how what was occurring in paradise as the town was bering scorched was nothing short of gut wrenching. I was able to see the disaster and how an entire town was burnt. The consequences of climate change are terrifying, and after watching this video I was horrified, California is in grave danger, the fact that our climate has already risen 2 degrees is a grave issue that is already beginning to harm us, as Ken said 4 out of 5 of California's most destructive fires have occurred in only one decade, this past one. With that being the case I am very worried for what this new decade has in store.

The fire in Paradise, California was the most destructive natural disaster in 2018 worldwide. I find it very sad that before this film I was not adequately informed of the true destruction of this fire. 153,000 acres, 14,000 structures, 30,000 homeless and 85 dead as a result of this disaster. The initial start of the fire was a malfunction in an outdated power line that was supposed to be turned off because of high winds. 
 <br><br>

Although the initial cause of the fire was the fault of the electrical company, PG&E, it was admitted by experts in the film that the consequences would have been far less destructive without the components of human induced climate change which included extreme drought and an extended fire season making for more fuel for the fire and higher winds making it much faster and more difficult to contain. The fire from Concow towards Paradise was said to have been travelling at eighty football fields per minute. 
 <br><br>

It has been proven that the number of wildfires in the western United States has doubled since 1984. This film made me feel very ignorant in that I was so unaware of this true destruction in my own state. I believe this film successfully displayed the true feelings and emotions of those affected because even years after I felt extreme stress and sadness viewing the videos of the fire engulfing the city of Paradise into complete darkness and embers. I felt the utter sadness of those who lost loved ones or believed they would lose their own lives that day. I felt all of this through the screen of my computer and I could not possibly begin to imagine being in that situation. 
 <br><br>

This makes me think about those suffering in the fires in Australia which is tens of times larger than that of the fire that swept the entire town of Paradise. It is very scary to think that these events occurred in my home state and how present they are. These events are not in the future they are already here affecting life worldwide.

The documentary “Fire in Paradise” showcases the true horrors of the climate crisis and how so many people’s lives are affected by it. Though the documentary didn’t focus as much on the climate crisis, I got more insight from Ken’s explanation in his YouTube video. This documentary was something that us viewers can see something so up close and see the emotions of the people trying to protect the homes and all the people who not only be evacuated but also those whose houses were burning down. I’m from Thousand Oaks and had to be evacuated from my house in late 2018 because of the Woolsey Fire. I still remember how my parents woke me up late at night and told me to start packing some clothes and valuable items because we needed to evacuate and wanted to keep our most important valuables safe in case our house burned down. As our car joined the mass cars leaving the city, I could see all the smoke and feel the air full of ash and dust. Although my house didn’t burn down, I had some friends who completely lost their house and everything inside of it. I can’t even imagine their dread when they got the news, because it could have happened to anyone and the only reason was because of the location of their house. Sure, the government might help you part of what you lost, but the memories and small valuables can’t be replaced and will be gone forever. Ultimately, “Fire in Paradise” provides an insider view to the firefighters combating the fire and the people evacuating houses, and it gave me another reason to believe that we all need to take immediate action to stop this from happening again.

I agree with you, the film did a great job at showcasing the horrors that people are already experiencing partially due to climate change. I've never experienced a fire, so seeing and hearing about what happens when fires become this uncontrolled was really eye opening. It really hit my heart realizing how much damage is already being done because of our inactions in climate change. Reading about your experience and professor Ken's experience made me even more concern as i realize that this is becoming the norm in California.  It's not just something that you see on tv, it's something that is affecting a lot of people. As the firefighter in the documentary said, this should not be normal. 
 <br><br>

What's  even more scary to think is that we're getting a glimpse at what the earth will begin to look like by the end of the century if we don't start acting now. We are already seeing huge fires all over the place, whether it's the Amazon or Australia, the trend is clear. Our planet is burning up, and not only did we cause it, we refuse to stop it. One can only hope that these catastrophes make people pay attention to the issue, because it's clearly a very hard issue to get people to take up.There is nothing that makes you pay attention to an issue more than when it happens to humans. Hundreds of species in danger? No one cares. Coral reefs? no one cares

I wouldn't wish this on anyone, but it seems like it's our future for now.

I thought this film fit into the course because it shows a likely scenario with the increasing climate change. I’ve read comments saying it seems fictional and I understand that because the people in Paradise couldn’t believe it either. Officers stated that they hadn’t ever planned for a fire like this so there were so many levels of uncertainty. I was angered by the response of one of the service officials. He claimed “People have to be responsible for their own safety”. The nurse had been trying to reach her husband and as she’s driving down Pearson street, she frantically  explains how she can see the fire, the car is filling up with smoke. She turns the street and there’s already cars lined up, on fire, and abandoned. Sure, they hadn’t experienced a fire this big, but I don’t think they did enough to finish their job. I don’t understand how fast the fire was moving in just a span of two hours and how the people weren’t aware of much. What confused me the most was that they switched warning systems to “code red” knowing not all the sign ups were there. The wildfire started from a piece of equipment that failed 7 ½ miles from paradise. A piece responsible by the PGE company. At the end of the film, someone said that PGE declined to speak but disagreed with what was being said. 
 <br><br>
I was concerned when Ken said that the biggest 15 wildfires were here in the US but even more alarmed when realizing the fire in Australia is 4 times all of the fires combined. As the district attorney was interviewed, one of the questions was “Do you think you should’ve envisioned a plan for a fire like this?” and he responds, “I’m not gonna answer that question”. Throughout the film you can clearly see the difference in attitudes between the different operators and officials and I wonder if it has anything to do with their views on climate change.
 <br><br>
I know I wouldn’t have wanted to be in that area with those people to depend on but is it going to be much different anywhere else? At this pace, climate change effects are happening slowly but surely and it’s time to get prepared now.

When it comes to natural disasters, a brush fire is usually one of the first that comes to mind as I live in California relatively close to brush-heavy areas. However, I never really knew or even gave much thought to them and their properties. It is scary to know that climate change is making these fires more and more common every year. And it’s true, speaking from experience - they have gotten more frequent and more severe through the years, but I never knew that climate change was a factor that made this true.
 <br><br>
The film does a great job in breaking down an example of how a fire can start and get out of control very quickly. Things such as the fire being inaccessible for a variety of reasons such as unsafe terrain for on-foot firefighters to poor weather conditions for choppers to fly in are reasons that fires can grow quickly as they are not contained in a timely manner. It’s a scary thought that fires like these can happen even in cases like this where the fire department was prepared for a fire due to the conditions, yet still couldn't stop it on time. I think that the film showing video from the firefighters’ perspective, along with giving the documentary a sense of humanity with 911 calls makes this project very powerful. It shows the magnitude and the effect that fires have on the environment and people as well. The film was also very informative speaking on global warming and its effect on wildfires. Thinking about how climate change is making places more vulnerable to wildfires by causing droughts and extending summers is very alarming. This leaves me with questions too. If climate change gets worse, does that mean that droughts in California will only get worse with time thus making the state even more vulnerable to wildfires than it is now? Also, should companies like PG&E be held more accountable for their actions in order to prevent future accidental man made fires like this one?

Just like you, in the past I never really gave much thought to brush fires in California. My hometown was never directly affected, and as a result hearing the news about horrible fires seemed like such far away problems. In the past two years since I came to study at UCSB however, I’ve gained so much more of an understanding of the world and broadened my horizons. Hearing about the Thomas Fire and late last year when the Camp Fire started while school was still in session, I was absolutely mortified. Thanks to climate change activists spreading awareness regarding the climate crisis, I now know that anthropogenic climate change is to blame for the increasing frequency and worsening severity of wildfires in places all across the world, not just California. Of course, just as Ken points out, there are many more problems and disasters than just wildfires and sea level rise that the planet is going to have to deal with in the coming decades. 
 <br><br>

Regarding your question after watching the film about how droughts in California are going to get worse and exacerbate the problem by making it even easier for devastating wildfires to pop up, I think the answer is a definite yes. It’s like a positive feedback loop. As California (and certainly other places around the world) continues to suffer from drought, the land will become increasingly prone to wildfires that will only get worse and worse with each iteration, so to speak. It’s an extremely scary reality, and it’s even more terrifying when you consider, again, that there are a multitude of other issues that climate change is going to bring to the table.

When the fires in paradise first happened, I was shocked about how destructive they were. After watching this film, however, I feel extremely devastated for those in the fire. Hearing the first hand stories from those who experienced this catastrophe gave me a better understanding of how these fires effected a normal city just like mine or my friends. The images and videos from the fire show the amount of damage that was done to the town in only a matter of four hours. 
 <br><br>
With 30,000 people who lost their homes, and weeks to find out the lives that were lost, these fires were heartbreaking and immensely destructive.
 <br><br>

In terms of the climate crisis, fires are a huge part of our reality and future. With hotter and dryer summers every year, and gusty winds, the occurrence of fires comes with no surprise. In fact, human activity has doubled the wild fire chances. since 1984. One major factor of the Paradise fire was that there was only a single evacuation route which caused traffic and car build up. While the town of Paradise did not know this was going to occur, it's extremely important to plan for fires in the future and create effective escape routes. Unfortunately, with the direction that the climate crisis is going, natural disasters will be more common and we need to have plans to deal with them. Ultimately we must work to reduce greenhouse emissions, and take the steps to reducing climate change, but along with that we need to account for the future we are heading towards.

I love what you said here! I also had previously had some knowledge of the fires in paradise and knew how destructive they were, but this film really opened my eyes up to the full situation that occurred. After watching this film I have been thoroughly impacted by the devastation and sadness that this natural disaster brought to this area. I was unaware of how impactful fires truly are on people's daily lives until I watched this video and realized just how much damage fires are capable of. The idea that the people in Paradise only had the one road to escape was the scariest part of the film to me because I never considered the terror that would ensue when people are stuck in the middle of a catastrophe with no way out. The aspects of this film that had to do with how people reacted in times of crisis (body cam footage, 911 call, etc.) also made me sick to my stomach as I am from San Diego where we have had fires of our own, and it made me realize that this could have been a reality for me and my family at certain points. This film made me even more aware of the potential effects of climate change, and it is so clear that these types of events are not worth the immense amount of greenhouse gases humans are allowing to be emitted every day. We need to find a solution to our climate issues immediately and we also need to find a way to make it attainable for everyone.

Watching the film "Fire in Paradise" made a few key points stick out to me. How devastating natural disasters truly are when you get an inside look and realize how much each individual person is affected by the fire as a whole, and how the same applies for each individual person being affected by climate change as a whole, all in different ways. Another thing that stuck out to me, was that if it weren't for climate change causing that 2 or 3 degree temperature increase causing a slightly more dry environment to be slightly more suitable for a fire to start, the fire could have been avoided almost if not entirely. This is especially important for us to realize if we want to start doing something about climate change. Every little bit counts, if you aren't going vegan, eat one less meat meal a week. If you take 10 minute showers, take 9 minute showers instead. Seeing how close and unified everyone in this town was can set an example in how we have to be if we want to help stop climate change. I lived through the 2007 October fires in san diego and they were devastating. I think climate change as a cause of these natural disasters needs to be emphasized more, as it is such an emotional topic that if everyone knew about climate change as a direct cause, they would be more inclined to make a change in their own carbon footprint.

After watching this film and seeing how climate change is affecting a city in the same state I live in, I can agree with Ken’s statement that the documentary “puts a human face on the climate crisis”. It shows the emotional baggage of experiencing a wildfire in your hometown and the tragedies that come with that event. The fact that the outcome of this forest fire was not unprecedented makes the situation all the more devastating. We continue to make the mistakes and fail to break the habits that got us into this situation, which will bring even more catastrophe. A fire sergeant said, when talking about the Paradise fire, “It was really hard to get your mind around how rapidly it was developing.” That statement is a perfect parallel to the entire climate crisis and this discourse around it. We can only see the small amount of damage that surrounds us, but we don’t realize the full impact and intensity of the situation until we see the full picture. So many people deny the fact that the climate crisis is happening now, in real-time; it is scary to have to realize the breadth of the issue and that its impacts are already being felt, even as close as in your backyard. Another interviewee stated, “It was an event that… literally outpaced all the planning that had been done prior to this.” This can also be said for the entire climate crisis issue. Warming and intense weather conditions are happening at rates that we could never have imagined. A shocking fact in the documentary was when they stated, “We measure climate at weather stations, and when fires burn, we trace their footprint. Those types of analyses have shown that human-caused climate change has doubled wildfire since 1984 across the western United States above what would have burned without climate change.” There is no more time to deny or treat the climate crisis as an issue of the future.

The Camp Fire’s development was comparable to a snowball rolling down a hill, continuing to grow larger as it accumulates more and more snow. The situation began with the Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s faulty electric transmission line, as well as a series of unfortunate events including a failed mass evacuation alert, and concluded with the inevitable avalanche: 52,000 evacuated citizens, 85 fatalities, upwards of 18,000 buildings destroyed, in addition to the trauma and loss that thousands of individuals must cope with for the rest of their lives.

 <br><br>

In recollection, the degree of damage caused to the town and its citizens likely could have been lessened, or even completely prevented. The firefighter’s dodgy response to the interviewer’s question was what especially led me to form this conclusion:

 <br><br>

[Interviewer: “Do you think you should have envisioned that [the spread of the Camp Fire from Concow, CA to Paradise, CA] happening?”
 <br><br>
Firefighter: “I’m not going to respond to that.”]
 <br><br>


Despite not having dealt with the devastation of a fire myself, Fire in Paradise really hit close to home. Seeing the girl’s pained expression as she explained the loss of her grandfather caused me to reconsider the relationships that I currently have with the people in my life.

I was really shocked by the documentary "Fire in Paradise". I could see facial expressions of those survivors were still panic when they were talking about what they had experienced in Paradise. One moment that showed people drove out of the fire and finally saw the blue sky was very impressive. I could feel how they feel as a viewer. However, one thing that I am curious about is why firefighters did not try to put down the fire for better evacuation purposes? They could control the fire that was approaching roads so that fewer cars would be burnt, and probably would have fewer people stuck in the traffic with panic. They said they could not find the firefront so they could not put the fire down, but why was that important? Doing something is better than doing nothing (personal opinion).

Fire in Paradise is a heartbreaking documentary that puts a human face on the Camp Fire. But more importantly, it puts a human face on the climate crisis that we are now facing today. Fires have generally been a normal occurrence in northern California. As the people interviewed said, most fires across the canyon wouldn’t reach Paradise. This wasn’t most fires. But soon enough, this will be most fires. The Camp Fire is the new normal.
  <br><br>
Thanks to climate change, California now experiences a longer, drier fire season. CalFire hadn’t prepared for a fire of this magnitude. Now, cities across California should be expecting fires like this. Any doubters of climate change need to look no further than these recent California fires to see evidence. Our climate is rapidly changing, and if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as recklessly as we are, it will only get worse. Seeing this documentary truly shows the beginnings of our population dealing with the consequences of our actions. Viewers should be alarmed. What the residents of Paradise experienced is going to happen again to another town. And again, and again, and again. This is the new normal. And that should terrify us.

After watching "Fire in Paradise", I feel frustrated about the climate condition. The wildfire is getting worse every year. Every year the news would say it is the largest fire ever, then next year it becomes another largest fire. The situation is getting severe each year. The climate change is happening everywhere, and everyone should care about it, we shouldn't think it's none of our business since it's still far away. The wildfire is happening outside of California, and it caused loss not only for companies but also for individuals. I hope people can start to care about it, especially the electricity company. The company shouldn't just think about profit, they should think about citizens instead.

The "Fire in Paradise" film was a very tragic but eye-opening film.  The reality of California wildfires is extremely frightening.  Wildfires have occurred in the past, but recently I see it more frequently on the news.  Wildfires are one of the many effects of climate change and as they are occurring more frequently in California people are starting to realize how serious the issue is.  I find it upsetting that it takes a direct tragedy to make people want to change their poor lifestyle habits.  I can admit that every person might feel like they won't make such a big difference by changing parts of their daily routine, but by individuals coming together to change for the better it becomes a group effort.

Almost every California resident has their own wildfire story. Just 3 months ago, I and the rest of the students here at UCSB were threatened by the Cave Fire. To us, wildfires have become not just a common occurrence but also a part of our culture.  Fires are not anticipated to come. They are expected. Sadly, the normalization of these events only plays into the growing complacent attitude that our society  directs toward climate change. Wildfires are part of a sickening trend that encompass only a fraction of the threat that climate change poses. As the consequences of climate change increase, the threats to our well-being that come as a result become ever present.  "Fire in Paradise"  does a fantastic job of presenting these outcomes as not merely a possibility but a definite reality. By presenting followable narratives to the audience, the documentary places the viewers directly into the lives of the victims. The abundance of camera footage from the scene allows the audience to witness the amount of pure carnage and destruction that came as a result of the Camp Fire. As I watched the documentary, I couldn't help but make comparisons between the city of Paradise and my hometown in suburban Los Angeles. The sheer amount of people that live in the area coupled with the lousy infrastructure would make a large wildfire devastating.  If traffic was bad when I was trying to get to school, I couldn't even imagine how it would be like in an emergency situation. There have been times when wildfires touched down on the edges of our town and nearby cities, but I was fortunate enough to not have to evacuate. If it took me over half an hour to get from my house to my high school only 4 miles away, then it would be next to impossible for me to escape a roaring wildfire. To me, this documentary did an amazing job in illustrating the disaster that will come as a result of climate change.

When I read the first sentence of your comment I was saddened to think about how true it is, and how often it can continue to occur. The normalization of fires is like acceptance that this is now the world we live in. It is sad and shouldn't be the attitude. I agree that it goes hand in hand with views on climate change. People are normalizing the weather patterns that should be happening and that are a result of climate change. Overall, the film shows that this (climate change) will affect everyone everywhere. As Ken said, it doesn't matter how rich the place can be because it happened in Montecito. It doesn't matter how prepared a city thinks they may be, climate change will continue to cause major destruction everywhere. No one expects it to hit close to home. No one expects it to be them. I did not expect it last quarter in SB, and I can't imagine how those in Paradise, CA felt.

Although Fire in Paradise is not technically a documentary about the climate crisis, it does, in turn, show the very real consequences of our inaction. In the last lecture, someone commented that the residents of that area were very conservative, but after the events that took place, there was a huge change.  It continues to baffle me how many climate deniers there continues to be, but it just goes to show that they won’t believe in the climate crisis until it’s staring them right in the face. What is the craziest thing to me, is that this fire would have never reached to this extent if our world wasn’t tackling the effects of climate change. Human-caused climate change has lead to wildfires to double in intensity. California is now dealing with strong winds, longer droughts, and warmer winters, the perfect recipe for a long and devastating fire season. Even though the Campfire was so devastating, compared to the fires in Australia it is nothing. It is absolutely insane that the fifteen largest fires in California history combined are still four times smaller than the fires in Australia. The fires have already claimed so many victims and more are sure to be affected. We have come to see that the extent of climate change does not end with sea-level rise, and it would be ignorant to think that we will not reap the consequences of our misuse of fossil fuels. It is perhaps one of the most frustrating things to see all this suffering and people still have the audacity to say that the climate crisis isn’t real. It has gotten to the point where the world is literally screaming out to us that there is something seriously wrong. Just imagining the pain and fear that all forms of life are experiencing because of the climate change is absolutely heartbreaking.

<p>
Wow. After about minute 36, I finally had to take a break…
  <br><br>
I sort of wish I was warned about the intensity of this documentary, but I guess it’s good to be aware of our reality. This was a really sad watch and I’m not sure what to even write after that because I’m at a loss of words for the first time in my life I think. It was so sad to hear about the cop who was on the phone with the three different women trapped in the room and he says after about 9 minutes, he was talking to himself because no one was on the other side anymore- and that he then had to just click the next answer button and do the same thing over again. I can’t even imagine what it was like for all of these people who had no warning whatsoever. I think it’s greatly ignorant for anyone to blame the police and firemen on duty that day, or the 911 operators…like they showcased throughout this whole documentary was that it was unforeseeable and impossible to contain. It became apparent so early on that it was turning into every man for himself. The firefighters can’t even fight the fire because they’re in rescue mode. This documentary made me realize just how unpredictable our world is now more than ever. Hearing about the companies choice to not shut down their power lines reminded me of about a year ago, my home town of Joshua Tree -with Edison as the main electric company in the small desert - decided to shut down certain areas of their company because of a high-wind alarm. Looking back, I didn’t even realize what a huge step in prevention this was. There were countless complaints throughout the town and even the whole county about Edison’s decision to shut down the power lines in certain areas, but it makes me wonder what could have happened if they didn’t. It also makes me realize that I, at the time, and a whole lot of other people were ignorant and blind to the possibilities of catastrophic evens due to climate change and I think if more people would just sit down and try to learn about something they don’t know about-the climate crisis would finally seem possible to confront. Read a book, read an article, watch a documentary. Just anything to open eyes to a subject that so many people don’t want to look at. Rant over. And I’m so sorry for anyone who was affected by this fire and many others….

Also, I think this is a GREAT way to get people to notice climate change. Sometimes you have to SHOW people the effects rather than EXPLAIN the science.

<br><hr>
I can relate to your experience while watching the documentary. I also felt a sense of hopelessness and panic when I watched the footage of thousands of people scrambling to save their lives. I'm glad that I didn't have to experience that, but with the changing climate, it's hard to say that I never will. I think that it's important for firefighters and governments to take the event of a fire very seriously not matter how big or small they think it is. I agree with your statement that we shouldn't blame the firefighters or 911 people because they had to look out for others and themselves. However, I think that a lot more could have been done to prevent this from happening in the first place. I think the mindset of people getting used to disaster could be a major issue. 
  <br><br>

People who deny climate change or don't see it as a major issue would not take the proper caution to ensure the safety of others. Also, the cause of this issue is not climate change alone. Some describe it as a "chaotic natural disaster", but I see it as more. I think the PG&E company should have never been allowed to keep 60+ year old power lines in operation. On top of that, they should have turned off power due to the high winds and dry weather. In an area like Paradise, it should be mandatory to shut off power on high risk days. Paradise is covered in highly flammable pines and pine trees. I don't understand why a major catastrophe wasn't predicted or why they didn't implement multiple roads to combat gridlock. People who don't see the climate change as a threat, like the mother who refused to leave her home, often have a false sense of security because they haven't seen just how dangerous it is. For example, the fire chief said that he is "fully confident" that the evacuation plan was a "success". This attitude is unacceptable. If he was more aware of the dangers of the climate change (dry land, high winds,fierce flames), he probably would have implemented a more viable and updated evacuation plan. On top of that, he and others working in the field would have warned residents much sooner. I hope that we can learn from the disaster of Paradise.
<br><hr>


I was also deeply saddened to hear about the three women trapped in their room. I cannot even imagine being on the receiving end of that call. I also agree with you that the police and firemen are not at fault. The winds were extreme and unexpected making it hard to track the fire's path and speed. I truly think they did the best they can to handle the situation having not been prepared for the deadliest fire in California. Yes, if they could go back in time they should have sent out an alert earlier, however, with the infrastructure in Paradise, gridlock and scarcity of vehicles would still have been trapping people admits the flames even with an alert sent ten minutes earlier.

It's very awful and alarming not only the numerous fires over the years that took numerous lives but why it took so many people to finally believe in Climate change after it happened in an area of wealthy Americans. Is this really what it takes? For lives of people who matter to be dead for climate change to be considered a threat to humanity and everything that's in it? I'm very dissapointed in our countries course of action of doing anything in regards to the climate and how much it can harm people as well as our loved ones especiallly to the future generations coming up. 
  <br><br>


Even though i know I shouldn't be mad at the course of action from the Firefighters Chief from the "Fire in Paradise" film, he believes he did everything successful and I would have to disagree because a more urgent earlier evacuation calling the people of Paradise could have saved numerous lives with just a few minutes of a notification being sent out. Still I the firefighters have my upmost respect for putting their lives on he line they are truly heroes.

"Fire in Paradise" was much more moving than I thought it would be.  I had already done a lot of research into the failures in communication (such as the Cal Fire notification issue, the failure of the landline reverse 911, etc.) but through all of this I only read transcripts.  Hearing the audio files for many conversations I had seen before and watching all of the dash and body cam footage was surreal and affected me far more than just reading.  I particularly remember hearing the 911 call where the three ladies were trapped in their house, and then you realize you are about to hear them die.  That was far more powerful to me than the official transcripts or post mortem interviews.  

  <br><br>

I think this documentary was particularly important to this class as it shows us the consequences of inaction.  Though there is very little direct mention of climate change, it is clear that this is a real world disaster caused by our failure to act quickly enough.  The longer we wait, the more events such as the Camp Fire will occur.  

  <br><br>

This documentary also showed that preparedness only goes so far.  The town of Paradise had a fairly comprehensive evacuation plan that could empty the city quickly.  Despite this, the sheer speed and intensity of the win fueled flames quickly overwhelmed the plan.  Even if there had been no delay in instigating the evacuation plan, it is unclear as to whether or not everyone would have gotten out in time.  The forces of nature were just too powerful to deter, and this paints a grim picture for the near future.

This documentary was important for a number of reasons, especially because it showed the ways that mistakes were made and how looking back may or may not have been beneficial. It is obvious that in times of emergency or disaster, split-second decisions have to be made and it can be incredibly stressful to decide something when so many lives are at risk. When you mentioned the scene in which the responder was on the phone with the women trapped in their home, I agree that this was devastating and near-impossible to hear, but it was the epitome of what public safety officials deal with to put people first, and unfortunately do not always see a happy ending. 

  <br><br>

This film is also a great reminder of how essentially crucial it is to have plans and orders in place for when disaster strikes, which is 100% inevitable living in our current climate. If every fire that happens is the worst in history, we are in for some serious damage. There has to be no doubt in anyone’s mind that something catastrophic will happen like this again, but there can be hope if we anticipate such danger and work to devise plans to both prevent large-scale emergencies and how to minimize the pain felt by people along the way. I think these fires will continue to be the norm every year and will require new laws and safety that will have to be the norm as well.

This is an absolutely sad film. I think the saddest thing in this tragedy is that there are many things we should do that we didn’t. For example, in the film, PG&E should shut down the power line on a very windy day but it didn’t, and Paradise should have a better evacuation plan since the weather is changing but it didn’t have one. However, I also agree with the end of the film, where it said that we could shut down the power line and set a better plan. The climate is changing rapidly. The Paris Agreement allows 2 degrees in temperature, but California has a 2.5-degree increase in the temperature already. The cause of this rapid change of environment and circumstances killed many species on this Earth because they cannot adopt it. Now, it is hurting us. We cannot shut down power lines because there will be many days that are windy and dry. It is seemingly impossible for people to live a life that has frequent power cuts. We cannot make a better plan because it is hard to imagine what worse disaster is going to be there. Thus, the true thing that we should do but didn’t is to slow or stop global warming. 
  <br><br>


We kept saying that a day is the hottest ever, but it could be the coldest day in the future. In the film, it kept saying that this fire is unprecedentedly destructive, but this could be the most gentle one in the future. It is hard to imagine but the harsher thing is that this could be true. There are also other results of global warming. For example, the animals start to emigrate to a cooler place, which will carry germs from place to place, the hurricanes are getting stronger and bigger because the sea is warmer, and, of course, and sea-level rise. One day, probably, these extreme weathers are going to act together, and it will be hard to stop them. We can stop this now by acting differently. It is better now than never.

This documentary, "Fire in Paradise", astonishes me, because it depicts a scenario of hell. It describes the Camp Fire which engulfed the town Paradise on November 8th, 2018. This fire is not like the wildfires happened in previous years since its scale is so large that it burned down a large number of acres and killed many people. This huge number of casualties is not only caused by the fire, but it also caused by people who did not alert residents to evacuate immediately. First of all, the origin of the Campfire is ignited by the failure of equipment that brought a power line into contact with steel. Then the fire spread very fast toward Concow because of high wind. Another reason that contributes to speed up the fire is climate change which makes the climate hotter and drier, and it also leads to more frequent wildfires. Furthermore, people did not anticipate that fire will be more fierce than before, and they did not alert people to evacuate. In addition, there are some booklets which divides the town into many parts and lists the routines to evacuate. However, this strategy did not apply to this situation since the fire came from all directions and engulfed the town rapidly. Therefore, it is very difficult for residents to escape from the town since they receive the notification too late. Also, there is a problem with the way they notified the residents. Notification only can be received by the residents who signed up, so there are lots of people did not receive the notification. Despite that, the PG&E company that owns towers with average age of 68 has exceeded the expected average age of 65. This company should be punished severely to make sure that this company will not violate any rule again.
    <br><br>
    I'm really concerned about climate change since it did cause lots of casualties and it will cause more and more casualties, because it gets more serious due to the constant emission of CO2. However, it can be mitigated if people take action to reduce their CO2 footprint now.

"Fire in Paradise" was an extremely informative documentary that detailed the incredible speed of which a fire traveled over 8 miles to devour the town of Paradise in flames. Interestingly enough, the fire itself was cause, not by climate change, but by an electric company called PG&E. Nonetheless, this does not mean climate change had absolutely nothing to do with this anomaly. Yes, faulty and old equipment began the fires, but it is only because of climate change's impact on today's world, such as high winds combined with an extremely long and hot dry season, that was responsible for the "80 football fields per minute" speed at which the flames traveled. It puts into perspective just how deadly and catastrophic of an issue we're up against, and the lack of urgency officials seem to have despite constant warnings.
  <br><br>


A part of the documentary I found particularly appalling was the chaos within the city as a result of the incompetence of officials. While I do recognize that the fire was moving at unprecedented speeds and a disaster of this magnitude was completely unexpected, I have to believe at least part of the blame falls on the shoulders of those who were unwilling to listen to the voices of the people of Paradise, particularly the state firemen. Had they done so, I'd have to believe that a majority of those who perished, including the young woman's mother who refused to leave, would have made it out of the inferno alive. Still, props to the speed of which the city firefighters and police department acted to save the lives of civilians.

  <br><br>

This puts into perspective how much needs to change to accommodate the ever changing climate. New safety regulations must be adopted to counter the risk of wildfires, especially in California. On top of that, safety/evacuation plans need to be mandatory in every city and funding needs to be allocated to cities without the means to fund their own road reconstructions and safety plans. We must always stay ready, so in the case of an emergency, no matter the size, we already are ready.

The firemen that were trying to confine the fire at Concow did not expect the fire to spread that fast. As the documentary points out, they were unable to communicate or have a visual aid of how fast the fire was spreading. If they had declared that the fire was imminent without confirmation could have evoked panic on the community and possibly more fatalities. Then circumstances at which this fire was originated were just not taken into account and took them by surprise. Do I blame the firemen and policemen? No, I don't because regardless of what happened, they stayed behind to rescue as many people as they could. It is their jobs to maintain us safe. 

  <br><br>

I do agree that they could've been more efficient but not everything goes as planned. As someone in the documentary mentioned, they proposed to build roads that would lead outside the city if a fire was ever a threat, but this idea was denied because it sounded crazy. I do blame higher officials such as politicians who often times do not do anything  to help mitigate such dangers.

  <br><br>

Lastly, I just want to say that I also agree on this idea that the fire was not caused by natural actions but rather human actions. However, this incident was sped up by climate change  and because of that, the fire intensified, changed and became something we hadn't seen in years. Situations like this should make us thing about our future and our children's future. We may think that this will never happen to us, but this is uncertain nowadays.
<br><hr>

I totally agree with your points about the documentary and I found it very useful reading your suggestions for dealing with the potential wildfire. “Fire in Paradise” is one of the most alarming documentaries I’ve ever seen. Before watching this documentary, I’ve already seen the rampaging wildfire in Australia and known that was a thing. I’ve never ranked the wildfire problem as high as other problems, but now, I completely changed my mind. While watching this, I felt unprecedentedly enervated and heartbroken for those victims who suffered from this catastrophe and the vegetation being destroyed when the wildfire was devouring the town of Paradise. What’s the most astonishing is how fast the wildfire spreads infectiously and how wide it gets within a short period of time. Quite honestly, it took me a few minutes to really think about the relationship between the climate crisis and those wildfires. I feel like this documentary straight-up reminds me of how climate change keeps affecting our living environment.

  <br><br>

After all of these thoughts, I started feeling emotional and frustrated. The 911 dispatchers and the fire department could have made the situation less miserable by just simply doing something that helps. There are possibilities that could’ve made us secure more people within that catastrophe, but we just didn’t act. Near a hundred of lives just passed through our hands, what a shame. Moreover, PG&E just gets me. Caused all of these bad consequences to happen, PG&E wasn’t penalized because it’s a state-wide corporation. I just think it’s totally unfair and unethical that PG&E didn’t get what it deserves. 

  <br><br>

Overall, this documentary did a great job showcasing a real wildfire situation and triggering the audience’s anger and anxiety by appealing to pathos. I wish more of this type of documentary could be released and put up on the stage.

What was most alarming to me about the film was how it only took four hours for the whole town of Paradise to be burned. I knew the fire was bad but was unaware of how quickly it struck. I couldn't help but think of my own hometown in northern California. Like many other towns in the state, it is surrounded by dry, rolling hills for much of the year and it only rains for a few months out of the year. What happened in Paradise could easily happen to my hometown. All it takes is one cigarette butt, one downed power line to destroy a town in a matter of hours. I sympathize with the calfire and local officials as well. They had evacuation plans in place and in the grand scheme of things were quite prepared. This was an unprecedented event, and there is simply no way to evacuate a whole town on a single road in a matter of hours, especially early in the morning as was the case in Paradise. As for PG&E, they are probably one of the most hated companies in the state right now. Their years of negligence are finally catching up to them, and they are finally being pressured into improving their infrastructure. The problem is they are in so much debt that they can't do this to the extent that they need to. One solution may be for the state to absorb PG&E, as taking the company from stockholder control to state control could make for a more manageable enterprise, as decisions could be broken down to a more local level within the utility itself.

After watching the film “Fire in Paradise”, I feel depressed. A fire has never seemed to be so close to my life. When hearing the 911 phone answerer talking about his experience answering phone calls, I could feel the desperation in him. There is a question, who is to blame? The PG&E is sure to take a part of the responsibility, but is it the only cause of this tragedy? Of course not. The fire department was not able to report the accurate situation of the fire in time, leaving little time for the people living in Paradise to evacuate. Another problem is the local alarming systems. They were not able to send evacuation orders to everyone in the area in danger. 
  <br><br>
Is that all? According to the fire department, what makes a seemingly normal fire developed into such a tragedy is the unexpected growth of the fire. There has been a 2.5 degree of temperature rise in the region during recent years due to the development of traffic and human activities in California. Overuse of water caused drought, and the heavy traffic raised the carbon emission of the area as well as the average temperature. These factors alone don’t seem to make a big different, but adding the high wind, them produce a perfect condition for the spread of fire. Weren’t the climate change, the situation should have been in control. There has already been reports about the continuously rising rate of wildfire in California, so relative institutes should have been aware of the danger caused by the climate change and be able to prevent the tragedy from happening. People should learn from this lesson that takes such a high price and starting to act in order to slow down the worsening of climate. Otherwise, the next fire might take an even higher cost.

I feel  the same way as you. After watching the PBS Documentary " Fire in Paradise," I feel really sad for the people who lost their loved ones, their homes and that many people weren't getting the evacuation warning. I like how you questioned who is to blame? There are many factors: underestimation of the spread of the fire, non-functioning emergency warning systems, PG&E irresponsibility, but the fact that it became the deadliest, most hazardous event in 2018, shows that people need to start asking why. Why are the fires are increasingly larger and more destructive?  
  <br><br>
The answer would be a combination of things you mentioned: temperature rise in the region, human activities, traffic, and high wind a recipe for a perfect fire. However, what's more concerning for me is how that the town of Paradise doesn't have that much cars (mentioned in the documentary), seem like the town doesn't emit that much emissions as the surrounding big cities like San Francisco. But, unfortunately, Paradise, surrounded with  trees, feels the most destructive effects from the fire. It seems a little unfair, but again I see the connection how less developed countries feel more impacts by climate change even though they emit much lesser greenhouse gases.

The first thing I want to address is the fact that California has had 5 of the worst wildfires and all of them have happened in the last decade. I find that so hard to believe because I would assume that after the first one and dealing with the aftermath there would have been some sort of change. Obviously that wasn't the case and then came the Paradise fire. While "Fire in Paradise" didn't necessarily deal with climate change completely, it did show us the effects our actions and behaviors are having on our environment. In the documentary, captain Matt Mckenzie stated that Concow had the most ideal conditions for such a destructive fire to take place. Not only had the area not seen rain for almost 8 months, but the air was extremely humid and had the worst drought conditions. This added to the fact that PG and E kept faulty power lines was only a recipe for disaster. It's one thing for you to turn on the news and see that there's been a fire that has burned a couple acres of land, but it is whole other thing to know that the Paradise Fire was burning at the rate of 80 football fields a minute. It's unfathomable to hear that and think that's normal. The "Fire in Paradise" did an amazing job at opening my eyes to the disaster and devastation caused by these wildfires. It also taught me that none of this should even be happening. Forgetting about the negligence of PG and E, our climate was not designed to not experience rain or constantly be in drought conditions. The way the Paradise Fire moved was unlike any typical fire and if that isn't alarming to others I really don't know what is. Another upsetting fact is that there are companies out there that have so little care for human life, and would rather keep outdated materials and jeopardize the lives of thousands of people over simply spending whatever amount necessary to stay safe. Although the documentary didn't outright discuss climate change, it did touch on topics relevant to it. Companies, where it be electrical ones or ones that deal with fossil fuels, have proven that they value monetary success over human life, and that they don't care how bad the climate gets as long as they make their profit.

When I watched Fire in Paradise I was shocked at the experiences the former inhabitants of Paradise shared. Fearing for your life is not a thing anybody should experience. The quick escalation of the situation form small wildfire to The Campfire illustrates that indeed things have changed regarding  temperature and nature of fire. Although this movie does not speak directly on the climate crisis or how to solve it it gives you aa good impression of situations that are happening because of climate change. People like you and me could be caught in a fire like that very easily and this movie adresses the very real dangers that are posed by the climate change. Furthermore I like the emotional appeal it had, whilst not pressing for any action. By constructing it like this it mentions a very real issue without being pressing about it. In this way people that are not looking to be convinced can still watch the movie and be more openminded towards the concept.



</p><hr>


<p>

I remember when I first heard about the devastating Camp Fire, I was ignorant of the negligence on PG&E’s part, and attributed to much of the public blame on them as distraction from the fact that many natural disasters are occurring as a consequence of the current climate crisis. The fact that the company was able to get away with the damage they caused is an extremely accurate parallel of the unfair abuse of power big corporations exercise in this country, and how their profits are prioritized above public/ environmental health and safety. 
  <br><br>

Although I was confused at first on how this film related to the topic of climate change, I now understand that the reason much of the focus was on the people who were hurt in the fire was to personalize the experiences of actual human beings in order to evoke an emotional response in the audience. Through this approach, the film does secondarily address climate change, but in a more empathetic, human-focused way. We get to see how one natural disaster affected a small, close-knit community of individuals, and that itself is a warning to us that if we do not change our ways and address the climate crisis head-on, what was reality for those hurt in Camp Fire will be the reality for all of us soon.

I completely agree with your part about PG&E, and how many people were unaware, and probably some who still are unaware of the big role that the company played in these disasters. The fact that the company was aware of the risks and was notified of the aging, or "expired" transmission towers and power lines, but did not act on it, shows extreme negligence and ignorance on their part. Even if there were thousands of lines that were overdue for replacement, the fact that PG&E is such a major corporation, they should have the resources and the plans to deal with it if they had planned on doing it originally. The fact that PG&E plays a huge ignorant role in the Camp Fire is also relatively similar to the number of Congressmen that are aware of the dangers and threat of climate change, but refuse to acknowledge the fact, and are even blocking bills in Congress because they receive money from fossil fuel companies. Fossil fuel companies, just like PG&E, are negligent to their actions, and continue to cover up their harmful actions in order to maximize their own selfish interests. 
  <br><br>
I agree with you that the film addresses climate change more indirectly, shown through the disaster that happened to the town of Paradise. It recorded the human emotional response to the disasters that have happened due to climate change, instead of focusing on the science behind it. It also only talked about one area of climate change, which is just the part about how climate change has intensified dry winds which have fueled wildfires in California over the past decade. This specifically focused documentary, while it does show the devastation of wildfires and relates to those that are threatened by this prospect, also tries to pull in the empathy of those who might not be as threatened, at the wildfire disaster.

This documentary was very eye-opening for me. It was surreal actually seeing what residents of Paradise had to go through. Seeing how it impacted these families from their perspective was gut-wrenching. Normally when I hear about fires going on in places around the world I am not that affected by it. Because it doesn’t affect me directly, I am able to not put too much thought on it. But having seen the devastating effects and the heartache families had to go through this film left me feeling pretty disheartened. There needs to be better planning and proper evacuation procedures in place for areas susceptible to wildfires. It is not fair to the residents who live there to not have such precautions put in place.

I had so many emotions watching “Fire in Paradise” none of these people expected this fire to burst out and “cross the canyon”. Yes, fires were normal within the area, but they had never reached Paradise, many people’s homes, cars, and valuables were burned into ashes, this was one of the most destructive fires in history. The difference between “Camp fire “and any other fire that has been in that area is that there were higher winds than usual, and the dryness of the forest made this fire spread very very quickly. It was shocking to see the miscommunication between the fire department and 911. So many people called 911 to ask about the fire and even told them that ashes were in their yard and were only given information that was not correct. Many people did not receive the alert to evacuate, that just blows my mind how nothing went as planned. How nobody was prepared for a fire like this, and many people were reluctant to leave their home because no one told them to evacuate. This film made my eyes tear up, just hearing the horror they had to undergo, imagine calling your significant other and telling him/her you are not going to make it because the fire has reached you. I believe that after “Camp fire” we all must be prepared for any natural disaster, have a plan and hope that it follows through, we really do not know the severity of climate change and the capability it has.

I don’t blame how unprepared the town of Paradise was in the sense that we had yet to encounter a fire like this. What I am upset with is why they didn’t send out the alert. They chose the one where only a number of residents were signed up for and even then those residents didn’t receive an alert. While I know a solution proposed was to widen the streets for an incident like this but that is just putting a bandaid over the bigger issue. The root cause is humans exacerbating the earth. As the documentary stated, “the climate crisis is not a static problem and it will only get worse,”. Temperatures are continuing to rise and the weather is only getting more extreme. That is why I gained massive respect for the response team; they did the best they could do in that circumstance. In addition to firefighters, nurses, doctors, and civilians collectively  worked together. When it came to evacuating the hospital, some people were coming out of surgery and others were coming out with full IV bags. Nurses and doctors loaded up their own personal cars while firefighters main objective was to save the civilians because. The fire was so different than any other… that was all they could do.

Fire in Paradise was the first documentary I have watched about the wildfires caused by drought conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis. As a resident of California, I am well aware of the rapidly increasing number of wildfires caused by our current dry, hot conditions. Although, I have never looked at this issue through a lense as detailed or as clear as this film. Fire in Paradise focused on a particular fire in a small town called Paradise. As a combination of interviews, live footage of the fires, police body cam film, and residential commentary, the film drew me into the storyline and left me wanting more. The creators of Fire in Paradise also did a great job of transitioning back and forth between the progression of the fire and the academic description of how the climate crisis has contributed to the increase in wildfires such as this one. This made it clear that the climate crisis is not just something that alarmists or overly passionate scientists are making up, but instead it is here, occurring in real time, even in sunny California.  
  <br><br>
Compared to the lectures and articles that have been presented in class so far, this film was also the most intriguing and easiest to relate to when it came to reasons to be concerned about the climate crisis. It seems like people are only interested or invested in something when it affects them. In this case, Fire in Paradise did a great job of giving its viewers a reason to be aware of the negative effects climate change has and will have on their lives and the lives of those to come after them. As Ken puts it in this video, "The documentary, Fire in Paradise, puts a human face on the climate crisis." This film made the climate crisis personal, especially to the residents of California, and of course to the residents of Paradise. If this doesn't get people to believe, I don't know what will.

The film “Fire in Paradise” almost seemed like it was a fictional movie. As I sat there watching it I couldn’t fathom that this actually happened. Although the Thomas fire in Santa Barbara was the biggest fire that happened in the past decade, the Paris fire is crowned as the most destructive and deadliest wildfire California has ever seen. The purpose of this documentary was not to solely focus on climate change, but to highlight the severity of this event and the trauma the people of Paris had to go through. I thought that this movie fit in well with the purpose of this class because this provides us with an example of anthropogenic climate change. 
  <br><br>

What really got to me was how this wasn’t the first time that the PG&E electrical company has been extremely irresponsible with their electrical towers. I like how the film highlighted that they treat the towers with no caution even when they know that they’re very old and have the “if its not broken don’t fix it” mindset. In this case, they are literally and figuratively  playing with fire and putting the lives of innocent people at risk with these safety hazards. Even though the climate conditions of the area made the fire catastrophic, this serves as an eye opener towards the viewers because events like these are only going to get worse. It was heart wrenching to hear and see all the stories of people who lost their loved ones and who had to go into survival mode to get out of the fire. Just imagining myself in that situation and the fear of all the people in that burning hospital should be more than enough to take action and reconsider our lifestyles and put a stop to enabling corporations like PG&E from being so irresponsibly destructive.

I agree that the film seemed surreal. Ten minutes in, I realized that this was real… and that hit deep. It was extremely hard to watch the film without crying. Since I already understand on a decent level how bad things are getting, it felt like a little much to have to watch this pathos-based documentary. I did, however, appreciate learning the details of it, how it happened, and what made it different from past fires. In particular, I appreciated learning how the fire was difficult to control because of the strong winds and pathless spreading. 
  <br><br>

In regards to PG&E, I’m glad that they have to deal with the consequences of their actions (at least a little bit). I wonder, however, what the externalities may be behind PG&E constantly turning off power in times of caution (other than that of people losing power for a bit). I really hope that real progress is being done in this area to prevent or reduce the effects of future wildfires, given they are inevitable.

<br><hr>
I completely agree. While watching the film, I had to pause at least five times to rant to my roommate about what I was watching. I had heard about the Paradise Fire after it had happened, but I was living at home, in Maryland, at the time and it all just seemed so far away and unreal. I hadn't paid much attention because of that. Watching this documentary, just over a year after the fire was incredibly infuriating. I can't believe that I had thought so little about Paradise after the fire. Typing that now sounds so selfish, but that's truly how it was. I was, of course, heartbroken for the people, but the distance between me and the fire made the reality less tangible. This film, along with the others we've watched in the course, forced me to confront what I hadn't at the time of the fire: the climate crisis is happening right now and has been happening for at least a decade. The fact that 15 of the 20 biggest Californian fires have happened in the 21st century is terrifying and almost apocalyptic. 
  <br><br>

While climate change was the primary cause of this devastating and unnecessary tragedy, it is still so aggravating that PG&E had multiple chances to prevent their role in the fire and didn't. They were warned about the deteriorating state of their equipment in 2010, eight years before the fire. This just proves the extent of climate change denial and money hunger within large corporations and the government. They had a role to play in preventing this fire and they didn't.
<br><hr>

I also thought that this was a fictional movie. I couldn't believe my eyes of the horrible images of this fire. It could be because I never seen a fire that close.  I also believed PG&E was a very poor decision company. They did not do anything to fix the power lines that are so old even when they were notified.  These businesses need to think and care about people instead of there companies.


<br><hr>
I have the same reaction as you when heard that PG&E electrical company are possibly connected to some of the other wildfires, and I agree with you that the company has been showing a very irresponsible attitude towards their equipment management. They are exchanging other people’s lives and making damage to the environment for a little amount of money.
<br><hr>
I agree that this film felt fictional due to the severity of its speed and damage. I also experienced the Thomas fires while at UCSB but even then, I never witnessed any of the great terrors of fires that were shown in Fire in Paradise. Seeing how the Camp Fire looked from a close perspective was terrifying and nothing that I would ever want to witness myself. In addition, seeing how an entire hospital had to evacuate quickly due to miscommunication of the location and spread of the fire seemed unreal. The communication between Cal Fire and the local fire stations in Paradise was terrible and I believe that was a huge reason as to why the fire became so destructive. No one in Paradise was prepared for the Camp Fire because they were told that it was not a problem for them. The film even mentioned that the city of Paradise had a new system called Code Red that could have notified everyone to evacuate but it was never used that day. 
  <br><br>
For me personally, I think that I found shocking is that if the road towards the beginning of the fire was accessible to fire trucks, that this fire could have never gotten to the size or destruction level that it became. I believe as a company PG&E should have looked into old towers in less accessible areas and either perform monthly check-ups on it or fully replacing them with new towers. If PG&E took better care of the maintenance in their towers that they have built, so many fires could have been prevented and no innocent people would have died. I do agree with the film that people could have had better evacuation plans, however, no one was expecting a fire to ever come this quickly towards them. In addition, two obstacles to evacuating Paradise were lack of communication to evacuate and fires causing roads to close down which left the population of the city scared and confused. It was saddening to listen to the 911 calls where the responders had to hear people say their last words as they called for help. This fire could have been prevented if our country, with all of its citizens and companies, took better precautions during this time of temperatures rising in already dry areas.
<br><hr>
I very much agree, PG&E was obviously extremely irresponsible with their electrical towers and really just in general. It showed just how much companies can forget the importance of the customers, the people actually buying their product, in exchange for more profit. This  cannot only be blamed on them, though, since it would have been hard for anyone to anticipate a fire spreading so quickly. We can only hope that in the future, this company and companies like this realize the effects of climate change and how worse things are going to be for it. Hopefully they put measures in place to ensure nothing like this happens again and understand that they must do more instead of doing less.

<br><hr>

I agree with you, this almost felt like a fictional plot.  I in all honesty don't remember hearing of the Paradise fire, but watching this made it something I will never forget.  I agree that this film highlighted the HUMAN CAUSED changes that we are seeing, and made them stand out as an obvious problem, specifically here as we see from PG&E electrical. The film really showed how we need to be responsible for our own actions, especially companies that deal with such serious things, as you put it, who "play with fire."

  <br><br>

 I too felt immensely for the families and the individuals who fought to survive the fire, and for those who lost their loved ones.  Growing up in California, fires have always been something I've heard about.  The drought and dry climate have always been an area of concern for me.  I remember learning about the drought in Southern California in elementary school, where we were suggested that the solution could come from us shutting the water off when brushing our teeth.  But it is so much more than that.  These anthropogenic fires should not be occurring.  The movie made me think of the cave fire which happened just roughly two months ago.  I know it was nowhere near as devastating as Paradise, but was still scary, and really made this movie hit home for me.  Prior to this November, I had never experienced a wildfire being so close to me.  It made it much more real, and I cannot even begin to imagine what the people of Paradise felt and endured.

"Fire in Paradise" truly does seem to be a work of fiction. I'm from Northern California and have never seen the fires in close proximity, only the aftermath of ash and smoke in the air. The film did an excellent job captivating the intensity of the fires and true destructive power the fire had on many communities. It brought tears to my eyes as I watched the clips of the fire, listened to the commentary, and heard the stories from victims. This film gave me an in depth explanation of the fire, what had caused it, the destruction it caused, and more. I completely agree with your comment about PG&E. The actions of the company have been incredibly irresponsible and dangerous. If they were aware of the towers’ poor condition, they should have fixed it to prevent any possibility of danger. The fire could have been contained before it became so widespread yet it wasn't, and put so much at risk. I remember the posts on social media of people driving away while fire surrounded them and the pictures of burnt wild life. The film expertly captured the pain people went through as a result of the fires, like you mentioned, losing loved ones and having to fear for their life. Watching this film as a Californian is devastating. It made me consider how another major fire could affect not only me, but my family, friends and communities. There is so much that can be lost when it comes to the destructive power of fire and it needs to be recognized. The Paradise fire teaches an important lesson about the urgency of prevention and preparation.

<br><hr>

I agree there should be stricter regulations to make corporations like PG&E have to maintain their electrical towers up to date to prevent future incidents. Although the fire was begun because the recklessness of a greedy corporation it definitely got to the imaginable magnitude because of the effects climate change has had on our environment and that led to the amount of devastation. I think the film demonstrates a first hand experience of the effects of climate change and what could happen again if we do not start taking action.


<br><hr>
I couldn't have said it better myself, the film almost seemed so unbearable that I couldn't actually fathom it being real. I started looking up information about it and when it occurred and where Paradise even was because I had never heard of it. I started thinking to myself, "what was going on in my life when this happened? why don't I remember this?" because it was such a catastrophic event that it's mind-boggling that not everyone knows about it. I also agree with you that it was definitely heart wrenching to watch, I couldn't help but tear up multiple times throughout the film hearing all the stories from the victims and their families. Although it clearly wasn't a climate change activist film, I think it was a really good pathos-backed film that really put things into perspective for me.

The documentary film “Fire in Paradise” demonstrated the horrible effect of global warming from the perspective of human, based on plenty of interviews of witnesses. On 8th November, 2018, A failed cable line cause fire from north of Concow and the fire rapidly spread to town Paradise. Over 80 people died in this most expensive natural disaster in the century. It is heartbreaking.
  <br><br>
The fire is changing, so should we. In this state of change, the only way to protect us is to identify and resolve problems rose in this tragedy. From my point of view, the most urgent problem should be widening the width of roads. Many people complained that in such emergency, they can barely move as the road is too narrow under this excessive amount of cars. And this reflected another problem-lack of preparedness. Fire department did have the plan for fires occupied different zones. However, the fire in paradise rapidly spread all over the town in just a few hours. Firefighters should, I believe, think of a plan to fight with fire under this circumstance. Last but not least, failed communication also played a major rule in causing this tragedy. Witness said “Nobody said anything to us”. There are no warnings to the residents during the rescue of the fire. Ideally, they should be notified by code red, while the truth is they found out what was happening on their own and got out on their own.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with this. I think it is bizarre that the PG&E electrical company putting so little care into this scenario and take action on the issue at present. Going to school at UCSB, it is painful to hear about the stories of the fires that affected their classmates, friends, teachers, family, etc. in December 2017. They are incredibly similar to these stories, and create a whole dark image in my head.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, I do think that there was a lot that could've been done to prevent such a high death toll. The PG&E electrical company deserves to be punished for being so neglectful and caring more about saving money than the safety of the people. The people of Paradise were left to fend for themselves as they were being given false information since they were unprepared and did not have enough eyes on the situation. Things are only going to get worse without action and yet the biggest reason for inaction is because of the lack of education surrounding climate change and the ways that people contribute to it. The only time most people are willing to take action is when it is too late and they realize what they have done. It is usually too late to reverse the effects by then. I just hope that human civilization wakes up before we are all in deep trouble, but the truth is many people don't care unless it is affecting them or someone they know and care about.
<br><hr>

I couldn't agree more. Watching this film I was in awe at how surreal it seemed. It really was like watching a fictional movie. Even from the beginning as the clock was ticking forward adding suspense, I was on the edge of my seat. Even while I knew what would happen, I was just hoping that the fires would be put out somehow or that the 911 operators would evacuate the town. I think that seeing the people rushing out of the hospital into cars was the most intense scene to watch, especially knowing that these people’s lives are already in danger and many of them are probably older and have weak lungs. Seeing myself someday working in a hospital it is hard for me to imagine the stress and the intensiveness of the situation. Even the recent small fire here in Goleta put me into flight mode, I cannot imagine what the people in Paradise had to go through as the flames were just yards away. 
  <br><br>

The fact that the fires were anthropogenic is heartbreaking, considering a wealthy electrical company had the power to prevent this fire, but chose not to. All of this horror and tragedy could have been avoided, people’s lives and homes could have been saved, if PG&E would have prioritized safety over money. It is sad to know that there are many other companies and politicians out there who are not doing anything to take preventative measures. The fact that it does not shock me anymore at how, as you put it, irresponsibly destructive companies are now shows how extreme this issue has become. The government is getting major funds from companies like these to stop implementing so many policies in controlling these large companies. I’m sure most of us have learned about the “laissez faire” government, but my question is why did the government not realize that this company was not up to date on its safety standards? We need to begin to elect politicians who will take action and not enable companies like these to control our world.

<br><hr>
I agree with this. Fire is extremely destructive. Living in California my whole life like most of you guys, I've seen plenty of wild fires. Even in our short lifetimes, we've seen the number of large fires increasing as we age, their destructiveness and size growing as well. I remember evacuating a fire that hit close to my home when I was around 6 years old; my parents were very worried. Luckily, the fire was stopped literally right outside our house, shown by the burn marks in front of our door. If a fire that did not property damage to us caused this much fear and worry, it's unimaginable how much pain the people affected by the Camp Fire went through. Seeing everything catch on fire so quickly did not seem like reality for me either. Fires in other places are becoming more dangerous too, like the fire in Australia recently. I'm glad fires like these are given media attention because they serve as physical proof of the effects of climate change, and hopefully, this will help move more people to action.

<br><hr>
I agree that watching this film honestly seemed so unreal like nothing that tragic could happen to us. That’s because nothing like that should be happening to us. Although the film does not direct its main focus on climate change in this film, we all know that this is a consequence of it and is so heart breaking. It’s devastating to think about how the people who sadly did not make it were felling during this time. Feeling hopeless and not having any control over what could happen next. That’s honestly how it is for this new generation. We have no control over what is going to happen next. The older generations made it, and are continuing to make it, worse for us. When these tragic events happen they are going to be so strong and hit us hard. Only then will people realize what has become of our world. Many people are going to continue to die at the fault of climate change, or should I say the fault of the people who are fueling climate change. It has already started and it only gets worse from here.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with your comment on this film. I didn't learn about the incident of Fire in Paradise before, so this film also seems like a fictional movie to me. The scenes that people are actually trapped on the road and the trees alongside are burning like hell; this is what apocalypse is, I guess.  When we talk about the destructiveness of a wild fire, we usually consider the land it took over, and maybe a number of casualty, that's it, they're nothing more than a few numbers. However, this film really brings us into what it feels like being trapped in one of the largest fire that turned day into night. The footages, the voice memos, the interviews all make me feel the desperation of the ones who experienced the fire, and of course, the ones who lost their family. Jordan and Christina's stories are simply heartbreaking for me. I had hope that Jordan's grandpa and Christina's mom made it through, but the end of the film breaks my wish. I can feel how much they care about their families and how helpless they feel in front of such devastating disaster. 

  <br><br>

And who to blame? I agree with you that PG&E is one of them. They can't just know that the towers' average life is 65 years but they're keeping the ones 68 years old. Also, they just can't say that "if a tower breaks down, then we'll fix it" because you never know how big of fire it could bring. But also, I think the 911 dialers are kind of responsive. Indeed, the information they got from Cal Fire is that Paradise isn't endangered. But when they're getting so many calls reporting the fire, they should maybe contact more than one groups to confirm that the fire isn't threatening the town.
<br><hr>

I agree with you, watching the film was difficult because hearing what the citizens of Paradise went through and the people involved escorting everyone to safety made me overwhelmed with emotions. It was also difficult because knowing that all of this could have been prevented if city officials have been well prepared for a more equipped escape route. Rather, having an escape route that worsened the situation than it already was because people were having trouble leaving town safely. Paradise is an example as to why we should all start to prepare for the worst because it is soon to come with the current state of Climate Change. It is astonishing to know that 4 out of 5 California's most destructive forest fires have happened in the last 10 years.

The documentary "Fire in Paradise" did a very good job of going in depth of one of the most destructive fires in history. As the film said, 10 of the most destructive 20 fires in California history took place in the last decade. This is a staggering fact, given that there isn't anything in particular that could be credited with that statistic, other than the climate crisis. As Ken mentioned in the above video, there are other aspects to the climate crisis than sea levels rising, and those aspects are often overlooked. I know I personally haven't encountered a fire anywhere near this magnitude in my life, and thus I hadn't really thought about them and the fact that their size and speed increase as the climate worsens. The idea that Paradise had an entire escape route setup, a new alert system, etc. is heartbreaking because it was clearly outrun by the fire. The fire spread faster than anyone thought a fire could, and thus the plan wasn't useful. Though this documentary doesn't talk about climate change in particular that much, it's clear that this fire was unlike one anyone had seen before, and the reasoning behind this was the climate crisis.
  <br><br>


The Camp Fire was unbelievably fast and large because of the high speed winds that were blowing higher up. As was stated in the film, normally wind helps put out the embers from above, but these embers were flying sideways, leading to a faster and further spread. Paradise was a fairly small town in terms of population, which definitely seemed to have an upside and down side, as it means there's less people to evacuate, but due to the size of the town, they only had the one two lane road to leave on, causing a gridlock. Thinking about this happening in somewhere more populated is terrifying, especially somewhere like LA, where the traffic is already bad as it is. A full evacuation seems like it could be almost impossible, especially with a fire spreading as fast as the Camp Fire.
  <br><br>


This film was very educational on the overall fire, but also in terms of the personal side of it. Real accounts that people gave on their thoughts during the fire -- their videos of driving through it -- really made the severity of the disaster clear to a viewer. I can't even imagine living through something like that. When the film kept stating the time of day and time since ignition was really crazy to look at; it all took place in the early morning. People's days had barely started, and then they were all hit with this natural disaster.



</p><hr>


<p>

It saddens me greatly to see the perspectives of people who were directly affected by the Camp Fire.  I was not near the area where the fire was occuring, so I was barely affected by the fire.  Where I lived, the only issue the fire caused for me was the smoke was making the air unsafe.  
  <br><br>

Watching this video makes me wonder if I have also been living with a false sense of security.  For my entire life, I had believed that if a disaster occurs there will be people who have anticipated this disaster and have plans that will get everything to safety.  However, after watching this video and seeing that the plans created to evacuate Paradise were not able to work efficiently, I am concerned that in the case that I am experiencing something like the Camp Fire, I will not be safe.  The evacuation plans we have created now were made with the intent to save everyone.  The events these plans were created for are events that are possible.  However, what if we were experiencing something that could not have been imagined?  The Paradise evacuation plan was not inefficient because they did not think things thoroughly, it was inefficient because a fire this large and dangerous was not believed to ever occur.
  <br><br>

I find it shocking that something like the Camp Fire occurred so close to me, and I find it even more shocking that the Camp Fire was something that could not have been imagined.  Unfortunately, because of climate change, natural disasters on Earth are becoming more severe than we could imagine.  It is important that people watch documentaries like this so they can see that climate change is not just causing the ocean to rise a couple inches, it is also causing severe weather that can affect anywhere on Earth.  Making the connection between climate change and disasters like this is important because it allows people to see that climate change has so many terrible consequences without requiring people to understand the science behind the effects of climate change.  Unfortunately, people will not pay attention to graphs and numbers, they will only pay attention when something bad happens.

Growing up in an area where I was barely affected by fires as well, I can relate to you experience as to how wildfires have affected my area in a way that diminished air quality for thousands of people. 
  <br><br>


While watching this video, I can relate to what you said about “living with a false sense of security.” We’re so engulfed in living in a tight-knit community that we tend to forget the realities of what is going on around us. Considering all of the wildfires in California, I think this film has made me look at wildfires on a broader scope. I mean, before watching this film, I never really paid attention to the traumatizing experiences that people, whom are affected by wildfires, have to go through. This film had us face the realities of what thousands of people have to go through. 
  <br><br>


Disasters like this today seem to be inevitable and you brought up a good point about how people have to anticipate these disasters. While having evacuation plans mapped up and everything, we saw from the film that it wasn’t enough no matter what they had to experience in the past. Having plans that will efficiently prepare people for what’s to come sometimes aren’t enough. It really poses questions that revolve around situations like this. No matter how prepared they were, nothing really prepared them for significantly this fire was going to impact their lives.
  <br><br>


People only pay attention when these things directly impact them.

This documentary truly sent chills across my body as I watched footage of panicked civilians and law enforcement fighting to escape the engulfing flames consuming their homes and town. I grew up in a small town in northern California just a few hours north of paradise, and I thought I was aware of the mass destruction it had caused. After watching this film, I have an entirely new perspective on the severity of the fire regarding the experiences of the individuals  trapped in the flames. This documentary serves to not only portray the extensive environmental destruction, it more importantly portrays the humanitarian crisis that occured as well. When many people, including myself, think of the consequences of forest fires, I believe we think of acres of blackned, barren land left over from engulfing flames. In reality, these fires have extreme consequences on communities and have taken many lives. This documentary was extremely effective in expressing the fear and panic individuals felt as they literally had to drive through the flames to survive. I believe that if we begin to understand the effects our climate crisis has on the lives of human beings and not only on the environment, more people will be eager to join the cause.

this footage was also deeply upsetting to me.  I grew up in Southern California, an area that is used to wild fires.  In fact, we call October "fire season" and are not usually alarmed with the smell of smoke because we are so used to it.  While I have been evacuated many times during my childhood, this footage was especially scary to me.  We usually had a couple of hours warning before the final call to evacuate and were usually far gone before then.  I cannot imagine the panic that these citizens felt.  I felt this episode of Frontline did a really good job of portraying the emotion felt by those impacted.  There was several times where I teared up, imagining that it was my family trapped in the flames.
  <br><br>

I agree with your statement that people will start to be proactive against climate change when they realize their own lives are at stake.  Like a student said in class, many of the people of Paradise were conservative and generally did not believe in anthropogenic climate change.  Now that the dangers of climate change are present in such a violent way, with their entire town being burned down, the citizens may be willing to see the other side.

The name of this documentary is ironic to me. Thinking back to English 22, this title sounds like it’d be a reference to Christianity. Christianity views heaven as a paradise: a metaphysical place that is perfect and untouched. Additionally, the garden of Eden is paradise-like and seen as a locus amoenus. Fire, in a biblical context, is tied to hell. The title “Fire in Paradise” portrays a chaotic and atheistic scene. The idea of a place that is so perfect and untouched up in flames is hellish and contradictory. 
  <br><br>

This idea shows that truly no one is safe from climate change. On the day of the campfire, no one knew that the initial fire could burn as hot and as quickly as it did, putting so many lives in danger. The fact that 88 people died due to lack of preparation, warning, and time is tragic. Climate change is a new killer and people should be alarmed and horrified by this fact. The entire town of Paradise burned to the ground. Not only is this shocking to me, but I’m also especially shocked that I had not heard about it until now. I was at school in southern California and I did not know this fire had happened. The media needs to make sure that people all over California are aware of these devastating events. Just because people are not directly affected by these fires does not mean they can go unnoticed or underappreciated. I feel the media has failed the public in this way.
  <br><br>

I also think that one of the issues with this documentary is that it does not mention climate change enough. I know it is mainly about the campfire and what happened but I feel as though the film could have dedicated a bit longer to discuss climate change as a whole and explain how bad it has made the fires (more statistics and such).

Having been born and raised in California, living here my whole life as I'm sure the majority of students at UCSB have, the documentary "Fire in Paradise" was deeply saddening and worrisome on a personal level.  The fact that a community, mere hours away from the home where I grew up, could be leveled by flame in the span of under a day is frankly terrifying.  I can remember days from high school where most of the students wore masks to protect themselves from the smoke coming from northern fires, and days where school was altogether cancelled because of the air quality.  I was working in a retail store at the time, and can remember multiple people freshly evacuated, sometimes soot still on their body, coming in to get supplies that we gave for free in a minuscule attempt to help them through such an awful thing. If we were feeling the effects of the destruction hundreds of miles away, I can only imagine what was happening to the neighboring communities, well withing the range of fearing for their own towns and homes.  And to think what it must be like for the people directly affected to see everything they have vanish in a day, possessions, livelihoods and even loved ones, is simply unimaginable.  
  <br><br>


Meanwhile in our national government, President Trump believes these fires are due to the "gross mismanagement" of our forests.  Gross mismanagement?  How about dropping the United States from the Paris Agreement for gross mismanagement.  How about increasing the amount of carbon emissions the U.S. releases each year by almost 3% for gross mismanagement.  And how about convincing, no deceiving, so many of his Republican voters that the climate crisis is a hoax, not man made, a political issue, or a democratic bid for power, when it is the biggest non-partisan issue facing our world today for gross mismanagement.  All while ignoring the devastation climate change is causing right under our noses, demeaning and threatening to withdraw vital funds from an already damaged state simply because it is filled with his political rivals.  I hope that when your precious golf courses burn you can look back and know it was your actions that caused it.

I completely agree with your thoughts on the fire and Trumps complete lack of care for the topic. Ken mentioned that people may have understood at first why this documentary was in this class, but I feel it's a perfect fit. The narrow scope of the film evokes sympathy and a sense of reality on the viewers; these fires are actually happening, the effects of climate change are all happening. I am from NorCal and I experienced multiple situations similar to yours, where school was canceled and people were wearing masks due to poor air quality. I couldn’t begin to imagine what was going on for families whose homes were lost. Even so, sometimes these events don’t seem real even though they are happening so close to us. The thing that makes it worse is that, like you said, our president is doing nothing to stop it. In fact, he does the exact opposite, deceiving people for his own gain. Although it's easy to just be angry at him, there's so much more to it all. There are hundreds of politicians, oil companies and others with tons of money and selfish interests. There self interest outweighs the urgent need to fix our planet, and we don’t even know their names or faces. It’s terrible to think that if we had acted early, if people just for once could value morality over wealth, then we could have potentially prevented this tragedy future ones like this. In my opinion there is still hope though. Every time someone speaks out and spreads awareness about the topic, the more pressure gets put on the selfish to act morally. Hopefully we can continue to bring media attention to Trump and others like him who don’t deserve to be making decisions for the rest of us.

I completely agree with this statement, regarding the fires and people in power at the moment dealing with this crisis. Growing up in California, I remember one summer when there was fire a few cities away from my home. Obviously not as severe as the fires occurring right now, but our family was worried nevertheless. My father as calling a family friend to see if he and his family were okay and telling them that if they needed to evacuate that our home would be open. My father also came home with masks and told me to put it on and I was bewildered.
  <br><br>
Luckily the fire was put out fairly quickly but that moment was seared into my mind. It wasn't until my first year at Santa Barbara that I actually saw the severity of the fires and all. The Thomas fire that had it raining ashes and power cutouts, so much so that final were postponed and people were urged to go home.   
  <br><br>
Actually seeing the Thomas fire and the many other consequences of climate change, it deeply angers me that Trump and most others in the administration are brushing the matter off so nonchalantly. Even making a joke of the matter and saying that we need more global warming with the cold weather. The utter ignorance in his statements and attitude regarding climate change are baffling. With all the evidence basically spoon fed to him, he still wants to drop from the Paris Agreement. He is focused on fossil fuels for the economy and such, but that is not the only thing important to the future of America. As stated in the article from last week "The Uninhabitable Earth" if there is no immediate change there will be no economy to run when there is permanent economic collapse.

<br><Hr>

I agree with how emotionally devastating events like this are to see, especially being from Northern California myself. I know some people from my church whose parents lost homes in the Camp Fire. I am glad that the store you worked for gave free items in an attempt to help those affected. It’s terrifying events that bring humanity and people together. I was watching this film in my living room and by the end of it, 4 of my housemates were drawn in, unable to look away from the destruction. 
  <br><br>
The thing that struck me most was the speed of the fires, within a morning, a whole town was gone. With that speed, it is hard to see how emergency services could have prepared to the point of full prevention. 
  <br><br>


I also agree that Trump was wrong to say the fire was a result of gross mismanagement of the forests when in fact it was due to extreme negligence on the part of a utility company that provides energy (mainly in the form of fossil fuels) to citizens. This truly demonstrates how dependent our society is on fossil fuels, even to the point of ridiculousness. If anything I think that the government (state and federal) should have gone after PG&E.
<br><Hr>
I think this documentary is literally a straightforward slap in the face for the climate change deniers because there is no way that those deniers can defend their falsely-constructed argument by stating that what this documentary showed did not exist or did not happen at all. Just like Ken mentioned in the lecture video, climate change is happening and is happening right here right now, and there is honestly no point in denying this truth. Sure, we have fire drills in schools and the city governments and counties have evacuation plans prepared for emergencies such as wildfires and other natural disasters, but from this documentary, it is obvious that all of the measures we have prepared hoping to better protect and save ourselves in times of events like this are very likely to be unsuccessful simply due to the huge scale and the high severity of the natural disasters. Natural disasters like the Paradise Fire will only become more frequent and more severe and affect more lives and more areas if we do not take necessary actions to address climate change, the principal cause of a series of natural disasters. I by no means am discouraging the preparatory efforts and preventive actions of the local governments concerning natural disasters like this wildfire; what I am saying is that it is also crucial to bring and raise awareness of the issue of climate change to the public and to more people. I completely agree with you that our president, unfortunately, is not fulfilling the responsibility of informing his citizens of the dangers and the pressing nature of the climate crisis and promptly passing policies and regulations in response to the changing climate and to tackle this environmental problem as the leader of a developed nation and the free world in many people's eyes.
<br><Hr>

I agree with you on how “Fire in Paradise” is worrisome in a personal level. It’s interesting that we watched a film on something that is not related to the climate crisis. This film was more interesting to me than other climate change films since it is related to California. I agree with Ken how people tend to focus more on sea level rise with climate change. I did not know that the Thomas fire in Santa Barbara a few years ago was one of the biggest wildfires in history. I was alarmed to learn that ⅘  of the largest wildfires in California happened in the last decade. It is terrifying how fires causes major damages even after it is put out due to the mud and debris that it causes. I’m sorry that you had to experience the Thomas fire and that there is a fear of your home potentially being destroyed from fires. 
  <br><br>
 I am also confused with what President Trump meant about fires being caused by gross management of our forest because I am also angered by the fact of him pulling our country out of the Paris Agreement. I feel that President Trump knows that climate change is a real thing but chose to convince his voters that climate change is a hoax for his own agenda. I found your last comment to be pretty funny. I do hope that President Trump can soon see the repercussions of his poor decisions.
<br><Hr>

I was also shaken by the film on a personal level. Having experience the Thomas Fire my first year at UCSB, I understood the anxiety and fear of the residents of Paradise before the flames engulfed the city. I felt the same anxiety in the last few weeks of that fall quarter, where every student wore a mask and the fate of UCSB unknown. Fortunately for us, we just experienced terrible air quality and ash falling from the sky rather than fires destroying our campus. This school year, a similar feeling came back as I saw flames on the side of our nearby mountains a couple days before Thanksgiving. Once again, students were wearing masks and classes were cancelled. 
  <br><br>
I also had to evacuate in 2007 due to a fire in San Diego. My family stayed at Qualcomm Stadium, living out of a tent and car for a while. A young me thought our house was definitely going to burn down. Thankfully, we were also spared in the instance.
  <br><br>
None of this compares to what was depicted in the film. The flying embers surrounding people and building, the flames engulfing both sides of the road, and immobile cars stuck in the middle of a large inferno. I cannot imagine the horrors of being in Paradise during the Camp Fire. Yet, as each day passes, these catastrophes may become more and more commonplace.
  <br><br>
I agree with your sentiment towards our national government. I am particularly annoyed at the lack of truthful knowledge or even care towards climate change and wildfire. Our president has said Finland simply rakes the forests to prevent wildfires. This “stable genius” does not believe the claims of the overwhelming majority of climate scientists yet thinks moving around a few leaves will prevent a fire.

<br><Hr>
As many of these comments state, growing up in California has definitely made me familiar with fire. But watching “Fire in Paradise” was still terrifying and sad, as people struggled to get out of their blazing town and you saw the reality of being surrounded by fire and the desperation of people trying to survive. It was my first year at UCSB when the Thomas Fire happened, and I remember the complete sense of confusion amongst the students, so similar to the residents of Paradise. Students were told different messages, and while we looked at pictures of the fire nearing the 101 freeway and searched for masks to help us breathe, sparse emails from the Chancellor told us everything was fine, until suddenly class had been cancelled and then our entire finals week. Watching “Fire in Paradise” was also terrifying because it showed that we can’t always rely on the people who say they’re there to keep us safe from these things. We can’t even rely on them telling us it’s happening. We have to be ready ourselves.
  <br><br>

I remember watching President Trump visiting the ashes of Paradise and blaming it on “gross mismanagement” of the forests. It is absolutely infuriating, and I definitely agree with the sentiment that President Trump’s own denial of climate change is gross mismanagement. It’s ridiculous to say the fire was due to gross mismanagement when the truth is that the climate is changing so fast it’s becoming impossible for us to adapt management quickly enough. The Paradise firefighters were overwhelmed because this fire was so different than what they had seen before. And if anything, there was gross mismanagement by PG&E, who literally get away with murder because our government seems to continue to value industry above people’s lives. We’re going to have to change our values and start holding industry accountable if we want to survive.

This is an interesting comment for me to read as I see this California Wildfire film through a very different perspective. You related to this issue with the context of familiarity and a close connection to these natural disasters as you’ve grown up with them. I am from all the way across the country in Georgia, a place in which risk of wildfire never crossed my mind. The scariest part of watching this film for me was not that it hit so close to home but the opposite that I barely even knew of this incident. Of course, I had seen these fires on the news but it was not something that in any way threatened me, so I would passively click away. This makes me ashamed of my past ignorance and makes me fear others living through this type of passive lense. Just because this natural disaster did not occur proximal to where I grew up does not mean I can ignore it. This is our country, our continent, and most important of all our earth. 30,000 people lost their homes and 85 died in a fire that firefighters never could have predicted. I think this connects directly into the main issues of the climate crisis as we, as earth inhabitants, need to see beyond ourselves and our surroundings, and rather see the effects our actions are having on the grand scheme.

I also agreed with your point of the political nature of these issues. Just the funding itself for an evacuation plan for Paradise was deeply gridlocked and political. Money was denied that could’ve saved so many lives, and yet our spending goes to so much corruption. It moments like these, citizens feel abandoned by the authorities. They feel abandoned by their countries leaders, and at the end of the day, the one thing they have is their land and their homes, and that too was stripped from them.
<br><Hr>
I could not have said it better myself. I was deeply saddened as well as filled with worry after watching this documentary. It makes absolutely no sense to me how people can still deny that the consequences of climate change are real when there are clear tangible events that are occurring and being severely worsened due to the effects of climate change. No one is safe from the effects of climate change. No matter where you live, how much money you make, what your political party is. Everyone will experience the devastation in one way or another, and it blows my mind that still, people refuse to do anything about it. I think of how everyday, my home town in california could experience a natural disaster, or how there was a wildfire raging right outside of my grandparents house that could have very well done damage, but thankfully did not. It pains me to see that still our political leaders refuse to act. They are so stubborn and ignorant and like you said grossly mismanaging their duties to the human race. My biggest worry is that there is simply not enough time to convince people that they do not have a choice but to believe and act on this major crisis we are experiencing. We are wasting so much valuable time trying to convince people that climate change is real, which science clearly says it is, and we could have been using that time to promote real tangible change. I just hope that these leaders will wake up and realize that this problem is bigger than location, bigger than wealth, and bigger than politics, because that is our only hope.

<br><Hr>
As a native Californian, I was also deeply affected by the documentary. Whenever there is a fire, many rely on the idea that it will be taken care of before it can get to us. This thinking is proven faulty when within only a few short hours, the entire town of Paradise is engulfed in flames. With climate change driving droughts, fires are worse than ever before, without even the rain to temper them. As fires get worse and more destructive, old evacuation plans become obsolete because the population simply cannot get away fast enough. As mentioned in the video, evacuation routes cannot be improved without millions of dollars in funding, which is not being allocated by our government. 
  <br><br>


I was a freshmen during the Thomas Fire, and the seriousness of the issue really struck me when classes were cancelled to allow evacuation for those who needed it. The air quality was so bad that we were advised to stay indoors and masks were handed out for free at Costco. I was grateful to be able to go home to San Diego, but many were not so lucky. Friends with family in the area helped them evacuate, knowing they may never see their homes again. I can only hope that these tragic events show people the immediacy of the effects of climate change, and urge them to act in all of our best interests.


<br><Hr>

I thought your comment was extremely well-said and also struck me more personally as well--living in NorCal, having school canceled due to unsafe air quality, wearing masks if you needed to leave the house. Being hours away from the actual fire just magnified the reality of how severe the conditions are for those experiencing it firsthand. It is extremely devastating to know that so many have lost so much to the fires. What's more devastating is what has, or rather hasn't, been done about this. Instead, Trump is encouraging policies and regulatory rollbacks that increase carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. His ignorance is hurting us all, and the fact that so many are suffering because of his selfish ideas is merely unjust. Trump scolds our governor Gavin Newsom for not managing the state’s forests properly, going to Twitter to vent about the poor job Newsom is doing. Trump, going on Twitter does nothing, rejecting climate change does nothing, and pulling us out of the Paris Agreement doesn't just do nothing it is worsening things to the point that your citizens are losing, suffering, and hurting.
  <br><br>


Watching this film has made my heart ache for those who have been victim to the destruction, but more so has made me so angry at the politicians and our own president who continue to deny that human activity is propelling climate change. Their negligence is killing us. It is truly sickening to witness such insensitiveness from our people of power.

<br><Hr>

This documentary was very, very difficult to watch. Everything looked exactly like home-- the landscape and structures were all things that you could see if you visited a mountain town. To see all of it burn in front of me on screen and hearing the victims' stories and realizing how even enforcement felt helpless was terrifying. How does something at that scale decimate everything in less than a day? Just how?? I hurt for the people who were directly affected. They lost loved ones and everything they grew up with and loved because PG&E couldn't be bothered to take care of their own equipment. Who is supposed to take responsibility when things like this happen? It drives me insane that there are still climate change deniers in the face of increasingly frequent "one-off events" like these and all the evidence that scientists work to put out.

<br><Hr>
It is surreal to deal with a fire, and also deeply concerning. I experienced dealing with fires and evacuations with both the recent Cave Fires as well as the Tubbs Fire in Napa, California. They were both incredibly stressful to deal with. I was under mandatory evacuation due to the Cave fires, and during the Napa fires I could watch the fire coming down a nearby mountain range from my  bedroom. Both were way too close for comfort. When you see the fire start to creep closer and closer, you start to get more panicked. You think of how insignificant certain possessions are, and you start thinking of all the scenarios you can of where the fire could spread. With how much dead vegetation there was anything can happen, especially in the high winds that fueled those fires. There was ash falling nonstop, and the sky was always covered with smoke for days. It is crazy to think that people experienced this to a far greater extent with the Paradise fires.
  <br><br>

I agree with your comments about how negligent our current administration is. It is unbelievable that we allowed people like Trump into office, but hopefully by this point people realize how ridiculous he is. His jokes about climate change makes me cringe every time I hear them. To think that someone could so easily disregard climate change is rather disgusting, especially in the face of so much evidence and data. I hope it does not take some monumental climate event to really change their minds about how serious of an issue this is, and hopefully we will soon have a new president in office who will actually make meaningful steps towards reducing our emissions and move us towards a clean, eco-friendly country.
<br><Hr>

The sympathy and worry followed by anger and loathing expressed in this comment hit very close to home for me, as a fellow Californian.  Having a front-row seat to the devastation of climate change in California very easily creates an overwhelming sense of worry and thus a need for action.  As pointed out in this comment, our governments lack not even of action, but mere acknowledgment is beyond frustrating.  By turning the scientific fact of climate change into a political partisan talking point, this administration is setting the worst possible example for Americans and the rest of the world that often looks up to our country. This is especially apparent when the disasters brought about by the climate crisis occur in California.  The partisan nature of the matter of climate change that Donald Trump and his administration have created is gross and as pointed out above, deceptive in nature.  The anger that I mentioned that came through in the second paragraph of the above comment is an obvious response when disasters strike in our backyards across California because not only are our loved ones and neighbors losing their homes, and for some their lives, but the current administration is using it as an opportunity to bash the science behind the climate crisis. What should be seen as a wake-up call to action is being used to promote the lies that continue to plague our country and further the crisis at hand.

What was most stunning and heartbreaking about the paradise fire was, for someone who was not born in California and has no experience at all with wildfires, just how universal the fear would be. I struggle to imagine myself in a situation similar to the one that the citizens of paradise were faced with, both because it is so sad but also because it is truly terrifying. We as humans have a naturally strong fear of fire, something ingrained into us at a primal level. Seeing people having to contend with fires of that size and magnitude is terrifying, regardless of where you grew up. 
  <br><br>
 What is most striking about this is that as a result of man made climate change, something that terrifying to humans on such a basic level is occurring with shocking regularity--our actions as humans are chasing us away in terror. The political cause of these events is not something to consider as much as the fact that companies like PG&E can “grossly mismanage” their power lines to the point where communities that should not have to contend with these problems in the first place are being forced to deal with a dry climate compounded, and not caused by these power companies.


<br><Hr>
I think this was a great comment. I can relate to this documentary alot not just because I live in California but because I was here at UCSB when the Thomas Fire happened. I remember the red sun and the smokey sky. I remember going to the bathroom and being unable to breath in the stall and freaking out. I remember seeing a girl coughing up blood. But at the time, I had no idea climate change set the conditions for extreme droughts and even lower precipitation that led to bigger and longer lasting wild fires. I learned in my global warming class last quarter that climate change warms the air, and that warmer air holds more water vapor, therefore area's already proned to droughts get even less precipitation (b/c the warmer air holds even more water), leading to increased chances of wildfire, and less chance of rainfall putting it out. This is super scary.
  <br><br>
The point you make about President Trump is great and I want to take this Trump thing a different route than most people did when they replied here. I think what is happening points out a bigger flaw: capitalism. Capitalism is always going to drive people to short term profits and ways to earn more even at long term expenses. One example is right in the documentary. The governing board of Paradise could have built roads wider after the '08 fire so evacuation would be so much easier, but they didn't. Guess why? The documentary said it: It makes no 'sense' to do that when those roads would not be used everyday, only when there was a fire. Therefore it wasn't 'profitable' to make these roads. This is a pure injustice: choosing profits over something that could save lives. This is why the profit motive is so f*cked. It leads to immoral gaps in decision making, like the gov't did here and said "it's not worth the money" (really? are we putting a piece of paper (aka dollars) over human lives?) We see this example all over the U.S., just look at those who die because they are too afraid to go too the hospital because they can't afford to get treated. The documentary also mentions PGNE the company who's tower started the fire. Guess what? Their towers are over the age they are supposed to be thus much more likely to malfunction and casue a fire. But because it would be expensive to replace new ones, they would rather keep them and let them fall down (possibly causing a fire) just because it means they get more profit out of the tower, even if it puts human lives and the earth in harm's way. 
  <br><br>
This documentary was relatable, filled with emotions, and furthered my passion for being part of the fight against climate change and injustice.
<br><Hr>
I too am born and raised in California and am saddened that this is happening in my home state. This film revealed how the climate crisis has already begun to start affecting the world and our homes and how disasters such as wildfires are more potent and can spread faster and larger than ever thought possible. This is a wake up call for towns that are at risk to wildfire danger to update the plan,keeping in mind how wildfires in the current dryer and windier conditions can develop. 
  <br><br>
However on a national level, the government needs to come together and officially accept the truth of climate change and give the population the warning they deserve. What comes to mind is the mother that would not evacuate with her daughter as no official warning was given which led to her not making it out along with other older members of the town. All political parties need to put politics aside to acknowledge climate change to help convince doubters which are unfortunately much of the older generation who will undoubtedly suffer.

<br><Hr>
The film really did open my eyes to empathizing with loss especially the desperation which wildfires create on people when not even authority can help save them. Your statement is factually understandable as California has been increasingly worrisome with sudden and unavoidable events over the past decade. The film was detailed in putting the blame on PG&E for not replacing their power lines which were approximately 60 years old and did not consider many things. I thought that it was additionally concerning that Kory Honea, a sheriff in the film, said that “ultimately people have to be responsible for their own safety” because it is his job to protect people but he does not even acknowledge he will do his best in attempting to help people (30:23). It was emotionally painful to see people losing their loved ones to this fire in Paradise and having visually seen everything obliterated in a town which once was called someone’s home.

<br><Hr>
I absolutely agree with your thoughts on the negligence of our nation and other sources of power. Like Trump, I found it absolutely outrageous how PG&E could still claim to do the best that they could’ve when the towers on average were ALL past their usable age. And also the officials involved that hindered Paradise’s ability to upgrade their main road out of the city and the Code Red debacle and all other structural systems. 
  <br><br>

I feel very blessed to never have experienced a wildfire in my hometown, but as someone from SoCal, it feels just like a matter of time before my home is the next Paradise. Knowing that such a devastating fire is nothing compared to the wildfires in Australia is genuinely tragic and horrifying.
<br><Hr>
Flufinator45 Nicely put, I completely agree with your sentiment. Global climate change is the biggest non partisan issue facing our world, yet we continue to waste precious time on ridiculous party wars. I for one don’t want to stand around and do nothing, it’s time for action. Our homes, Our communities, our loved ones are perishing before our eyes and yet we still have the audacity to continue debating about the reality of climate change. Some of our leaders have shown again and again that they do not have our best interest in mind, they have been bought by the fossil fuel industry and have exacerbated our crisis. I’ve lived in Los Angeles my entire life and I had never experienced smoke and ash like that caused by the Camp or Woolsey Fire . I can’t begin to imagine how terrified and hopeless the victims of the fire felt , watching their homes and possessions burning away. 
  <br><br>
What’s even more frustrating is watching the president of the United States make a joke of climate change , when thousand of people are suffering the consequences of it . It truly makes you blood boil when such greed and ignorance is in control of our dear country . Corruption and greed are nothing new , but when they threaten the very lives of millions on this planet and the planet itself , then there must be a point where it will no longer be tolerated in any way. I’m ready for this country to change , and so are millions of other people , this will be the biggest challenge humanity will ever face.
<br><Hr>
I relate to this comment. I was good friends with a girl who lost a  friend and his father that were taken away by the mudslides in Santa Barbara, so this subject hits home. you never really realize how important things are until you're one of the ones affected by the outcome. I can remember a time when I was younger during the fires and thinking it was cool that ash was falling out of the sky like snow. that really puts into perspective how naive I was. 
  <br><br>
on the subject of trump, I come from a horribly republican family, so neither of my parents accepts or affirms the fact that climate change is happening. that alone is really hard to deal with because I feel so strongly about the subject of climate change and I just have to deal with my parents and their narrow-minded approaches to such a serious thing in our lifetime. Trump is affecting people's way of thinking, and convincing people that we have nothing to worry about and that the left-wing liberals are the ones overreacting about the subject. hopefully, in this upcoming election we can elect someone who really understands how detrimental climate change is on our earth.


<br><Hr>
Having been at UCSB long enough to remember the Thomas fire, I can agree that it was a truly singular experience. Going to class and passing by stations where they were handing out masks to filter the air was something I never thought i'd be doing. I went to campus to hand in a final paper with my mask on and the sky was dark red. It wasn't really something I thought was that weird at the time because everyone carried on as if it normal. Finals were cancelled and half IV stayed in town to celebrate with a game of die. Which looking back on it now is absurd and generally inappropriate because it makes light of the terrible situation that we were in. I live exactly 100 miles away from IV and during my drive home I could see the flames of the fire the entire drive.

<br><Hr>

Having also lived in California my entire life, fires are not a new experience for me. I've had to evacuate during fire season in San Diego and now the panic of seeing a fire in Santa Barbara the week of Thanksgiving with no plan to evacuate is a terrifying experience. Thankfully, the school did not need to evacuate and the fire was put out when it rained, but after having to experience fires so close to home, it does make one nervous every time there is one nearby. 
  <br><br>
The lack of action and acknowledgement seen from the federal government is infuriating when we're the ones who have to experience the panic of evacuating during these fires and fear losing our homes. Also, considering that Trump decreased the budget for interior (which directly impacts national parks), how can he go to a burnt down town and blame California for "gross mismanagement" when there were many factors that contributed to this terrible fire.
<br><Hr>
I think that we can all mostly agree that president Trump is a giant douche and that is why we should focus our attention to voting for a more fit and caring candidate. We need people that actually care for the environment and won't be easily bribed by large corporations to do whatever they want. We also need to make sure that that candidate will actually go through with the plans that he or she has promised and not lie to public about what they want to hear. With this is mind I feel that this is our best option to inflict damage to large corporations such as PG&E for the harm and damage they have caused all of us. The fact that the fire caused by the malfunction of their property could have been easily prevented if they actually went through with the changes that were held against them really upsets me. I remember back when I was younger, I was playing basketball with my family at the park and the park workers came to us and told us to go home because the air quality was bad due to a near by fire and I thought that was bad. I can't even imagine the pain and suffering the people in the fire actually felt. It was nice to read what you did for the people getting supplies in your store, it was very wholesome. We need more people like you to step up and help others in times of danger.
<br><Hr>
I was born and raised in California, too. This is a place I love and will always call home no matter where I go. Throughout my adolescence and young adulthood I have been seeing our golden state burn to the ground. It seems almost every year we have these "wild" fires (these are NOT natural). Every time I hear about a fire, it has become normal to me now. I hate that I have come close to being desensitized from this issue because of its constant recurrence. This documentary revitalized my values and empathy about these fires. They affect everyone. If it's not burning down your neighborhood, you are breathing it in and it's warming us up. "Fire in Paradise" does a good job of being a tear-jerking film. These are people who's lives are being severely impacted and most of them thought that was their last day of life. So if Trump doesn't care or refuses to confirm this climate crisis, he could at least have a drop of humanity for the people he makes decisions for. But he doesn't care about anything but himself, so we, the millennials and generation Zs, need to get our boots on the ground and do the work that others are failing to do.
<br><Hr>

Restless; the word that best describes how I felt throughout the whole documentary. This film was heartbreaking from beginning to end, and the saddest part is that only a third of California residents have probably watched it. Many have already forgotten about this fire, or probably didn't place much attention to it, to begin with. I know I did; all I can remember thinking was "Damn, another fire." I never for a second asked why another major fire was spreading, or what was the cause for this one. I simply continued my day and followed the news on political issues that I believed were the most important thing at the moment. Although to some extent they are, if I'm more preoccupied with what a certain president is tweeting instead of a fire that wiped out a whole town while killing so many, then there is a problem. I understand how you feel and hope we stop being bystanders to a situation we can prevent as a whole united society.
<br><Hr>

I agree that this documentary was very upsetting; however I do not think the firefighters and first responders can be blamed for the way they reacted. It was said in the beginning of the film that typically there is time to assess the fire and alert the people through people on the scene and from the air. The only reason that this was difficult was because the first responders had to immediately star saving people once they were on the scene and they had no air support because of the high winds. I do not think it is fair to hold it against the fire fighters that they were too busy saving people and did not have extra help because of winds caused by climate change. 
  <br><br>

What upsets me is that there really was not that much that could be done to lessen the effects of this fire. It was spreading unprecedentedly fast and no matter how hard the firefighters worked to save people and how quickly those in the hospital evacuated, the devastation was unavoidable. It is very terrifying that in some natural disasters, it is really impossible to fully prepare and that the climate crisis is constantly increasing the likelihood of these disasters.
  <br><br>

A couple years ago, in Orange County, where I live, we had a fairly large fire. An evacuation warning was sent out while I was home alone and I had to pack up our valuables by myself while my parents were stuck in the traffic of people trying to evacuate. Luckily, the fire did not reach my house, but it did burn much of the canyon that I grew up running in. I understood the people in the film who did not see the seriousness of the fire until it was already very close because even after I got the evacuation warning, I felt that I would be fine and that the fire was still far enough away not to worry. If this fire had been moving as quickly as the Camp Fire then I would have been very ill prepared because of my false sense of confidence that I had experienced plenty of fires growing up in California and did not have to stress about it.
  <br><br>

Also, it is pretty unbelievable that PG&E is able to get away with so much because of the power of their corporation and that they knowingly refused to turn off power in order to make more money. The film mentions that now they are trying to change their ways and turn off power on high risk days, but obviously they are not doing this because they actually care about people's safety. Their main reason behind it is because they cannot be liable anymore due to how much they owe in damages for what they have caused; it all comes back to them continuing to want to make money and save themselves.

I am very glad to have watched the documentary Fire in Paradise because I am much more informed about this deadly wildfire incident that happened only a few hours north of my home. The way in which the film was structured to show hourly progressions of the fire, match live footage with what the interviewees were saying, and share personal stories was effective because it was a highly organized way of making the viewer feel as if they lived through the event or making the viewer empathize with the people of Paradise. There were so many issues and red flags that were raised to my attention just from this documentary’s analysis of this situation, that it is of vital importance to learn from this event that destroyed Paradise in just four hours. One of the biggest problems that stood out to me was that communication just wasn’t working. Although there were forces out of authority’s control, such as the cell towers going down and the speed of the fire outpacing all resources and emergency planning, now that it’s happened, current city evacuation plans should consider how to communicate an evacuation to their residents if technology fails to be a means of information transmission. However, Kory Horea, one sheriff from Butte Country, said in the documentary, “ultimately, people have to be responsible for their own safety.” He is not wrong. The fire in Paradise highlighted the possibility of dangers where even the people whose jobs are to protect us and save our lives won’t be able to be saviors. It’s a sad reality, but it’s also a reminder that we should be prepared for times when we have to use our own judgments rather than wait around for notifications or orders from authority to save our own lives.

It breaks my heart. I just finish watching the film, and I even cannot finish it all once, because it is so heart-breaking. I finally get to know what a fire truly like. I realize how scary it is, and what it’s like to lose who you love in this disaster. I am sad and sorry for all of that. And the most terrifying thing is that climate change is even making that process more frequent to human lives. I think we really need to stop that from happening again in the world. We cannot suffer more tragedy like that. NO MORE.
   <br><br>
The film is so emotionally impactful, and I still cannot get over it even after a whole watching this film. It’s not a thing we can stop when it’s already there, so let’s just make it not happen again.

I went to the library with a good friend to study together. I decided to watch this film because we will stay here for roughly two hours. It’s becoming cloudy outside. This film, the wildfire is very scary (I am even shaking while writing this). I knew that wildfire is very frightening but I never thought that the on fired ashes would drop on the street that looks like raining. There is no chance people will get out of this. Cars even may explode because of the on fired ashes.
   <br><br>
This wildfire is not caused by people polluting the Earth. Wildfire is barely caused by people polluting the Earth. There are wildfire these years in China, America, and Australia. There are plenty of good and must-implemented solutions, but I really doubt that these good and must-implemented solution can solve the problem. Seriously, I wish wildfire don’t happen again. We can’t afford it.
   <br><br>
By the way, leader of country shouldn’t be at vacation when there is a wildfire.

After watching the documentary “Fire in Paradise”, I was completely shocked and terrified by how devastating the wildfire truly is. I can’t believe that wildfire could spread so fast and could burn for months being hard to be extinguished. My attention was fully grabbed when the experiencers, from rescuers to escapees, described their stories and feelings in that urgent time. It is also heartbreaking to realize that some of the victims lost their lives because of their lack of seriousness toward the start of the fire. If the emergency department could have given a more direct instruction to the residents and being well-prepared for guiding the evacuation, fewer tragedies would happen. Events like this should be a wake up call for the nation and the world: not only does prevention for further disasters need to be emphasized but also the awareness of self-rescue.
   <br><br>

Now to think that the increased climate change will lead to more wildfires and cause them to happen more frequently is very terrifying. The one going on in Australia today is informed to be over 12 million acres, which is 4 times larger than the 15 largest wildfires combined in California history. Wild animals like koala and kangaroo are losing their homes and even lives. Seeing these catastrophic consequences brought by human activities, we need to ask ourselves “Is it really worth it?”.

I have similar feelings after watching the film as to the rapid speed the fire spread, the inadequacy of the emergency notification system, and the degree of damage. This film provides me insights into California wildfire as it illustrates different perspectives on this issue, including some rather sentimental perspectives such as the granddaughter's and the wife's perspectives, some official or authoritative perspectives such as those from the CalFire or regional office coordinator, and some academic perspective from renowned professors dedicated in closely related areas. I strongly resonate with Zihan's heartbreaking feeling when I realized some of the deaths are due to lack of notifications. This really strikes my thought and evokes me to reflect on the responsibilities of related organizations versus individuals' personal duty to protect themselves. I think both sides have certain responsibilities to take on to maximize their possibility of survival, but there is certainly room to improve for both sides. On the other hand, the uncertainty and variability of natural disasters also makes the preparation work hard to execute, so I also think that sometimes it is hard to attribute blame to solely one person or organization, but it's more likely to be the result of the society as a whole. However, several big players in an issue should certainly be more obliged to operate with safety promises and fulfillment. 
   <br><br>

This film really helps me to visualize the huge impacts of wildfire and the relevant consequences of wildfire becomes more authentic, vivid, and profound in my mind. By watching those heartbreaking scenes, I feel that we should promote more actions and efforts to reduce the occurrences of wildfire by focusing on the factors causing them such as the safety of electricity corporations like PG&E. I realize that companies that make huge profits should also carry on the huge responsibilities they have to the society. 
   <br><br>

The last part I felt shocked is when Ken mentions the extent of Australia fire. I have similar reflection as Zihan's and I think we really should put more efforts into finding the balance between natural preservation and human development.

<br><Hr>
I completely agree with you.  I have lived in California for many years and seen lots of wildfires happened here. Before I watch the movie “Fire in Paradise”, I would think it’s not a big deal if nobody hurts in the wildfire and fire is put out immediately. The biggest influence on wildfire behavior is just the property or land being damaged. Also, It’s really hard for me to find the connection between climate change and wildfire. Until now, I can still remember how terrible the air was when the wildfire happened last year in Santa Barbara. 
   <br><br>


When I was watching this movie, I sympathize with those people whose houses or family were broken by the wildfire. I was so horrified by how destructive the wildfire is. Not only the family or property was damaged, but also the wildfire damaged the lay of the land and caused landslides. It’s really scary. Many people don’t realize the culprit of wildfire. When the fire is put out, no one would care about the consequences anymore. Climate change causes the Earth to get warmer and warmer and California is an arid area. It turns out making a perfect place for wildfire. I hope people can really learn a lesson from the wildfire happens in Australia. Wildfire will finally be put out someday, but the damaged environment will never restore like before. We should appreciate the present.

The opening of the film immediately drew me back to the article that I read yesterday for this week’s assignment. I remember reading about that PG&E acting only in times of extreme risk and giving people two-days’ notice before turning off electricity. However, they seem to not view this event as “extreme” and by the end of the film, the narrator said that the company would turn off electricity at their own convenience, leaving residents literally “in the dark.” No wonder PG&E needs to file for bankruptcy protection. 
   <br><br>

I was surprised at how emotionally attached I was to this film. Seeing the amber surrounding the hospital actually brought me to tears. I can’t imagine the degree of fear that the residents of Paradise felt on Nov. 8, 2018. One of my neighbors from last year learned that his house was burned down and one of my acquaintances’ grandparents tragically passed away in this incident. Perhaps these personal connections left a deeper mark on me than I’ve realized.

Christina’s story played a flashback of the Woolsey Fire in the head. Her mom refused to leave the family home. When my family was forced to evacuate during the Woolsey Fire a little over a year ago, my mom was sitting in her car in the driveway, reluctant to leave. I, on the other hand, kept calling her and begging her to please go somewhere, anywhere… Seeing the video she sent me of our backyard lit on fire sparked more fear than I’ve ever experienced. My mom said the roads were packed and cars weren’t moving. That memory paralleled to what I viewed from the film; drivers frustrated with roads that were jammed from all angles. I think the ultimate hero was the firefighter who ended up using a bulldozer to get abandoned cars out of the way to clear the path for others who were trying to flee. 
   <br><br>

I think it’s important to practice evacuation plans. Not just zone by zone. I believe a larger scale needs to be performed to ensure future safety. Regardless if this plan will be carried out only once in a century or none at all. Lives are lives and it’s the most important thing we have. I understand that this film was not a direct educational resource in terms of learning about climate change but looking at an example of what will happen as a consequence of our neglection to this climate is probably more effective than knowing why it’s happening. I pray that tragedies like this won’t have to happen again for us to learn the lesson.

This weeks video focus on the heightened fire hazards caused by warmer weather, unpredictable winds, and years of drought leading to fast spreading, highly combustible regions of California. Until recently, the changes occuring have seemed to be located in far regions of the world-the melting of the icecaps, the melting of glaciers in Iceland, of the hurricanes hitting the west coast-yet all this time they have been located in our back yards as well. Unfortunately, in the region of California in which I grew up, deniers controlled much of the media, the scientific studies, and the way problems were expressed, leading to the long lasting drought in my region of California simply being referred to as an abnormality, something that would eventually go away. This was far from the truth, and the science, the facts, were simply ignored by politicians and the media. What I grew up with were the effects of climate change. Unpredictable rainfalls, unprecedentedly hot summers, high non-seasonal winds, and loss of humidity. These are the same effects of climate change that occurred in the city of Paradise and its surrounding area. Unfortunately for paradise, they also happen to be located in a deciduous/dry forest, meaning when a fire starts there, it can burn hot enough to dry the air and anything around it. Luckily for me, my hometown lies in desert region with little to burn, but the effects of change are still felt. 
    <br><br>
The story of Paradise is terrifying and sad, but unfortunately it may become the new norm. The fire itself was started by a downed powerline, nearly a hundred years old, but the combination of drought induced by climate change, and high non-seasonal winds caused the fast spread. Due to this, the power company has recently been causing outages in the instance of high winds to reduce the risk of such fires, yet this leaves thousands of California's residents without power. However, this offers a good reason for many residents to transition to localized power sources such as solar panels and Tesla Powerwalls to avoid the effects of outages and also combat climate change. It may not be the solution to climate change, but it is a step in the right direction. Even if we begin to practice what we preach, changes still will occur before the atmosphere readjusts over time, so we need to prepare for the effects.

"Fire in Paradise" gives a personal side to the climate change problem. An entire city destroyed from a fire in only a couple hours. It's scary how a fire can grow so big so fast. The city of Paradise was unprepared for such a fire - the roads were too small, cell phones stopped working, and few people were notified of the evacuation. Imagine the terror of being stuck on those roads as fire swirled around you and the entire sky engulfed in smoke. It is clear that we have to accept the reality that fires will only get bigger and more devastating. Fires can happen anywhere and we must prepare to evacuate and deal with these problems before it's too late. 
    <br><br>

The worst thing about fires is not knowing if your home will still be there when you go back. Paradise was destroyed and many people lost their homes and valuables. Life will never be the same for them and many people probably had to relocate. The only thing they can do now is rebuild. 
    <br><br>

Including this film was a good choice. Showing people the destruction made worse by climate change will give people a reason to fight against it. But if we don't act, fires will happen even more frequently.

I agree with your reflection that this was a great choice for this week’s film. "Fire in Paradise" definitely presented an overwhelmingly personal side to the climate change problem. The documentary was filled with raw emotion, ranging from several victims' tragic accounts of the chaos to the unedited footage taken during the fire.

<br><Br>
In addition to this, you mentioned the damage that is typically accompanied by fires. This really resonated with me. I cannot begin to imagine how devastating it would be for me to lose my childhood home or any valuables, let alone family members, my pet, and the entire city that I grew up in. I hope this film will serve as a reason for society to act as quickly as possible in order to prevent tragedies like such from ever reoccurring in the future.

“All of Paradise is on fire” The video showed footage of the Paradise fire up close and took the viewer on the experience of the front lines. It shows how climate change is making these fires more frequent and unpredictable. Watching this, I felt hopeless and panicked although that was not me, I feel for those people and can not imagine being in that position of evacuating a hellfire knowing you don’t have a home anymore. When it was in the news, I was checking on updates and looking to see what was going on but in no way was it as personal as these people who stood close to flames that were taking their homes and families away. 
 <br><Br>

Listening to the firefighters say that this fire defied any sense of what they deemed to be a normal fire. This shows how we will no longer be able to rely on the climates' traditional patterns because drastic ones like this one are occurring. In December, we received a hurricane warning for areas near SB and I was just confused because those are not common here, we are used to earthquakes. The thing that concerned me the most was people not taking the fire seriously or just in general when people do not take natural disasters seriously. Especially listening to Christina talk about how her mother didn't want to listen to the ‘negativity’ and choose not to evacuate and instead pretended nothing was happening. From the beginning, the firefighters stated, “a lot of people didn’t take it too seriously --we get a lot of fires up there” (6:51). This mindset can be a major issue because people are beginning to get used to these climate disasters we are experiencing and just think, “oh it’s not that big of a deal”. If we continue thinking this is normal and yeah it happens every year, people will not try to change and nothing will be done to avoid these chaotic natural disasters.

I completely agree. Watching this, I felt like I was watching a very realistic horror movie. It makes the viewer see actual people going through the tragedy as opposed to just seeing a number of how many homes were lost or how many people were injured. The fact that the fire was deemed as not a major issue made the situation much worse. If air support was used in the beginning, the outcome could have been much better. It was reported the fire was spreading 80 football fields a minute, which is 8000 yards a minute. This is nearly impossible to fathom without seeing it firsthand. In that situation there really is not much that can be done with modern technology besides evacuate and try to make sure people are safe. Seeing the experiences by the first responders and victims of the fire is both terrifying and heartbreaking. As one of the firemen pointed out, the fire seasons are becoming much longer and much more intense. Power companies, such as PG&E should be aware of this and make ethical decisions as opposed to greedy financial decisions. It is scary that this will only become more frequent in the coming years.

"Fire in Paradise" is an impressive movie. It vividly recalls the largest wildfire in California in the whole United States. The film not only recorded all kinds of things before and after the fire, including weather forecasting and interviews with the parties, but also recorded the scenes of the fire and the spectacular and tragic picture of the fire spreading. This movie is more than just a documentary, it affects people far more than that. On the one hand, it showed the people the scene of the fire, so as to warn electronic power companies, government departments, and the people how to deal with the disaster. On the other hand, it also implies to people to pay attention to environmental issues. It is reported in the film that human behavior has doubled the frequency of California wildfires, the weather in California is also becoming warming, and extreme weather is happening more frequently. All kinds of facts are in front of us. The movie tells us that the tragedy was not accidental. Even if the electronic power company in Paradise shut down the power supply in time, there will be various accidents leading to the fire in the future. If people do not focus on environmental crises, it is only a matter of time before a disaster occurs.

I agree as I was also thoroughly impressed with this week’s film. I knew that this fire was extremely devastating, but hearing that this was the largest wildfire in the United States and the most devastating thing that happened in 2018 was truly heartbreaking. I, also, was impressed with the different types of video snippets that were included in the film, as the film both showed the viewers the actual fires and people trying to evacuate as well as including video interviews with both victims, firefighters, and 911 dispatchers. It was interesting to see different people’s experiences. I loved the part where you stated, “the movie tells us that the tragedy was not accidental.” These horrible disasters, which are more deadly and are happening more frequently,  does not occur naturally. Human activity, especially coming from huge corporations, are causing extreme weather. This extreme weather, such as droughts and little to no precipitation is causing more and more deadly wildfires. In addition, after wildfires, civilizations are in danger of floods and mudslides due to burnt vegetation. When will we learn? When will corporations, such as PGNE, put the lives of people before money?

After watching the film "Fire in Paradise" I was really able to notice the effects of climate change in our own home state. This is unprecedented heat and wind that helped spread this fire is something that we see every year now and it is now becoming the new norm. Every year since high school I expected very hot summers and week long heat waves during the summer. In my hometown of Bakersfield, I saw first hand the effects of the drought that was going on in California, we had to be careful to water our lawns to a limited amount of times per weak, we couldn't wash our cars with the water hose and there were multiple water parks that were closed. That was my first experience with climate change and a direct impact on my life, and that is nothing compared to what the residents of Paradise experienced. 
 <br><Br>

The camp fire grew so large because of all the perfect weather conditions for such a devastating and chaotic wildfire. This can honestly become our norm from now on with we don't begin to take action against our carbon emissions. California appears to be more dry every year but when it rains or snows it does so very heavily and rapidly, the weather today seems very unbalanced and chaotic. Events such as these should be a wake up call for the nation and the world that we should take action now to prevent events such as these from growing into such deadly disasters. Companies should also be charged for their contributions to events such as these, for example PG&E should be held responsible for their negligence in addressing these known potential failures in their equipment. Now, to think that the fires going on in Australia today are 4 times bigger than the 15 largest fires in California history is insane and very terrifying. We are seeing daily now the catastrophic consequences of our human history and the damages done to our planet just for the commodities that we have now.

After watching the film, I had a similar response. It is clear that the effects of climate change are currently being experienced in our own home state of California. Living in Northern California, and experiencing the long drought periods the issue of climate change is becoming an increasingly pressing issue in our lives. Although I have never directly experienced a fire in my home city, I have had school canceled due to smoke that was carried to our area from a fire that burned north of the Bay Area. Because of the increasing fire hazards everywhere across California, me and my family have tried to prepare for an evacuation just in case we are ever faced with any circumstances that are anywhere close to those that families faced in Paradise.
 <br><Br>
My initial reaction to this comment and the film as a whole was shock that Paradise had put in place methods and equipment to deal with a fire evacuation but the situation destroyed these strategies and plunged the town into chaos that left them desperate for evacuation. In reflecting on this fact I tried to think of how this chaos and the breakdown of their evacuation plan could have been avoided but I struggled to come up with much. Because their emergency alert system both did not send off alerts to everyone and was not utilized properly, it left many citizens with a false sense of security. My only idea to help combat this is to hold PG&E accountable for their fault in creating the fire and get some large amount of money from them which can be put toward funding fire evacuation routes across California. Other than this, I think that combatting the increase in releasing greenhouse emissions would be the best course of action as we could hope to reduce massive, large scale fires instead of having to spend trillions on the aftermath of their destruction.

The film, "Fire in Paradise" was beautifully done to tug on the heart strings of the viewer, but also show them the harmful effects of climate change and how it will impact the future of fires. Throughout all the interviewers, you could see the pain and sorrow they still all feel from the fire. These people lost their loved ones, their town, and whole life. A thing I noticed was that it was a tight-knit, small town-feel community which may add to the sadness all of the residents feel. These natural disasters, such as the Camp fire, will only increase in numbers so it is sad to know that this loss of human and animal life will only grow. These disasters may become so commonplace though with the current trend in climate change that we may grow numb in our emotional response to disasters such as the Camp fire. 

 <br><Br>


What was the most alarming point they touched on was the affect of climate change on the amount of fires. With higher temperatures come more dry vegetation to burn and less of a chance for precipitation, thus making fire seasons longer. As one of the members of Cal Fire said, when he started in the 1980's the amount of fires was no where close to the amount of fires today. He, like the scientists in the video said, has seen longer "fire seasons" these days. Northern California has seen a rise of 2 degrees recently, only increasing the drought we are in. It is fair to say droughts will become more and more common as the temperature rises.
 <br><Br>


The devastation of the camp fire can also be linked to how well we were prepared for a fire of that capacity. Cal Fire continued to say they did not know how to fight it and combat a fire of that magnitude, or how to even get everyone out of town. As a result, many people lost their lives, and acre burn-age can be seen from Space. Agencies like Cal Fire will eventually have to adapt to the rising temperatures and effects of climate change. Fires like the Camp fire are just the beginning for fires of that size. If we do not adapt, we will only keep burning out of containment. PG&E started some adaptation, including shutting off power to lines when there is bad fire conditions. This may be a solution that we have to explore to avoid even more catastrophes.

I would also like to add that I completely agree with your viewpoint about how the film tugs at the heartstrings of the viewers. It was purposefully scripted to focus on the small community of Paradise, where all had been lost due to the Camp Fire, and focus on the devastation of such a local, tight, warm community. This point of view truly lets the viewers think, "it could've also happened to me". It does show the devastation of wildfires and relates to those that are threatened by this prospect. But, it also achieves the task of trying to pull in the empathy of those who might not be as threatened, at the wildfire disaster.
 <br><Br>
I also completely agree with you on the part where the documentary shows that the local area and Cal Fire authorities were completely unprepared for such a massive natural disaster and devastation. The fire moved at a pace that no one had anticipated or was prepared for. Represented by the story of Christina Taft within "Fire in Paradise", Christina's mother, like many other older residents in the area had not received an evacuation order, and had a false sense of security over the size of the fire. Therefore, many older residents preferred to stay in their place, and not evacuate until absolutely necessary to do so. In this sense, I do think that authorities can learn from this lack of preparation for natural disasters and improve for the future. As climate change continues, and the Earth continues to warm, California will face more and more devastating fires, therefore, we will really need an improved system of defense.

The film "Fire in Paradise" notably draws the viewers' attention towards the devastation and destruction of the campfire as a way to communicate to the viewers the reality of how climate change has the ability to lead to, events like in the film. The way the film depicted the chaos and destruction of that fire was difficult to watch at times because I sympathized for the whole town of people who had their lives uprooted by a fire that spread so fast because of the matchbox like conditions climate change created in the area. I sympathized most for the 911 answerer because he was having to listen to people burn alive not being able to physically help them and just reassure them help is coming. No person should have to ever experience such a horrible thing as he did and sadly more may experience similar trauma because climate change has made these super disasters a common reality. 
 <br><Br>

In my life when a new disaster occurs the news likes to focus on how this is the largest disaster recorded to date but treat it as an anomaly rather than a reality we live in where these disasters are increasing in frequency and strength. This then takes away from the urgency to correct the climate crisis because people would rather feel safe and think these disasters are random with no human impact than have to fear, they are only going to get worse and keep happening till we take action. People keep making the mistake of underestimating the effects of climate change, or not being able to imagine the effect of climate change and not being prepared for what happens. This is why we need to stop trying to predict whats the worse to happen because climate change has already proven to be worse then we imagined and rather we should focus on how to fix the eminent issues than brace for them.

When first watching the film "Fire in Paradise" I was slightly confused (like Ken mentioned in this video) as to why we were watching it for the class when it did not speak that much on the climate crisis. After watching Ken's video it makes complete sense now. I think that the film was very impactful in the sense that it showed us just how catastrophic these natural disasters really are and how they affect those who lived through it. I am from Ventura so two years ago when the Thomas Fire took place I had to be evacuated from my home. I remember getting woken up by my parents at 3 am and them telling me to grab my little sister, my animals, and all of my valuables, to get in my car and drive. As I was pulling out of my drive way I couldn't believe my eyes. The fire was about 50 yards away from my home. I will never forget the feeling I had as I was driving as I watched up in flames. With my little sister in the passenger seat and my entire life packed up in my car I drove to my grandparents house at the beach where we would be safe. We were evacuated for about a week. Listening to the stories of the Paradise Fire survivors brought back all of those emotions that I had felt during the Thomas Fire. It is not a secret that the world is warming. Our weather patterns are all over the place. When I leave for my 8am class I bike in what feels like freezing temperatures however when I come home for lunch it is a warm and sunny day. At night time the temperature drops once again. The only explanation for these strange and what seems like bipolar weather patterns is climate change. The Santa Barbra area specifically is getting warmer, drier and windier making it an ideal location for a fire to start. These wildfires are only getting stronger so we either need to take action or brace ourselves because you never know when the next fire will strike again.

 I totally agree with the point you brought up, and I feel sorry for your experience. When I first watch this video "Fire in Paradise", I was surprised by the facts in this movie. And same with you, after viewing this video, I understand why this climate crisis are becoming more and more. And I think everyone in UCSB experienced the fire on the mountain.We can just see the fire just across the mountain from the Catalina Hall. I was told that the fire was from LA. I believe this video will make more and more people realize that it is important to protect our environment. After seeing that big fire, the school cancel all the classes that day and me and my friends left the city immediately. But have you ever thinking about if one day us human has nowhere to escape. One day the disasters are going to be all over the world. At that time, where are heading to? Mars? I guess we are not ready yet. So people, let's start now! protect our environment.
 <br><hr>
 "Fire in Paradise" definitely does a good job of displaying the impacts of wildfires upon survivors and evoking the emotions that these disasters bring upon us who have experienced them. Similar to your story, I clearly recall in 2007 when the Witch fire in San Diego prompted local evacuations in my neighborhood. My dad picked me up from second grade and I said bye to my friends who were going home to pack their belongings and find refuge somewhere safe. Except when I got home, we didn't pack. We turned on sponge bob and made dinner and didn't talk about the fire. My parents, despite the proximity of the fire, insisted we would be safe until we absolutely weren't and, until then, there was no need for unnecessary worry. 
 <br><Br>

Thinking of this now, and the modern attitude of the escalating devastation caused by fires, I shake my head at the parallels between my family's mentality and the severity of the fires that are occurring. It's like all of the social media awareness being raised for Australia using the tagline "Just because it's not happening to you doesn't mean it's not happening." And while this is somewhat excusable when considering your personal safety in the case of a local fire, its very easy to apply this same mentality to understand those who insist on remaining naive to the natural disasters that are worsening in today's world. While it may be comfortable to sit and wait for it to be over in a safe personal space, as the climate crisis progresses and these disasters intensify, there won't be any safe space remaining to allow for an escape from the worry. As you say, we really are just waiting for when the next fire is going to erupt.

 <br><hr>
While reading through these comments I realized that, like you, many people have wildly moving personal anecdotes of a fire that directly affected them or someone they love. For many of us local Californians, we have been exposed to fires our whole lives. I personally have never had to evacuate because of a fire but I have had friends stay with me when their house was threatened by a fire in the mountain range directly behind my home town. After the fire had been put out, I remember hiking up the mountain and seeing the scorched earth, I was so grateful the fire had not progressed into the neighborhoods not 500 yards from where the fire had stopped. Unfortunately, my town was a lucky exception the the destructive rule of California fires. When watching "Fire in Paradise" I realized just how lucky my town is. I really liked your point about how, while the film did little to directly address climate change, its depiction of the paradise fires provides insight into what climate disasters look like as of today. While watching it I found myself thinking "this is only the beginning." It is a truly terrifying thought to consider the droughts, mudslides, and fires that have occurred in California just in the last 10 years and consider how these disasters will continue to increase in severity as the years go on. Just in the past few months we have seen major fires in the amazon and Australia of a magnitude much greater than the paradise fires. It is happening all around the world, and there is only a matter of time until the fires here progress. Its even more daunting still to think of how shifting climate patterns will bring new dangers to California, for example the tornado warning that was issued over thanksgiving break.
 <br><hr>

The film Fire in Paradise felt too close to home. I am also from Ventura County, where temperature is increasing faster than any place in the world. For the past three years, fires have burned Ventura County. First the Thomas Fire in 2017, then the Hill and Woolsey Fires in 2018, then the Easy and Maria Fires in 2019. When is this going to end? It seems like fires are just the norm now in November in Southern California. I considered myself one of the lucky ones when the Thomas Fire broke out. Though I was never forced to evacuate, school was cancelled for a month and you couldn’t go outside without getting a breath of smoke. From my living room window at night, I could see a fiery glow from the mountain side. It felt like it was the beginning of the end of the world.
 <br><Br>


I agree with you, this film really shed light on how major these natural disasters really are. The raw footage of fireballs raining and the overall chaos was shocking to watch. Seeing the time stamps during the film of each hour the morning of the Cave Fire was especially eye-opening. By 8am, the fire caused the sky to look almost black. I thought the one-on-one interviews with citizens of Paradise was really emotional. I cannot imagine the trauma that they went through. As the film went on, I felt connected to their individual stories. It made me furious when the film when the safety departments talked about the evacuation plan. Why was there no plan on how to evacuate the entire town? How come citizens were not officially informed to evacuate? How did someone let this slide by? I sure hope there is an evacuation plan in Santa Barbara if needed.

 <br><Br>

I fear that my city could be next if something is not changed soon. Climate change has clearly caused fires to be more frequent and bigger. The cave fire was able to burn the entire town of Paradise in just four hours. Millions of people live in places where fires could erupt at any second. It’s about time we put our differences aside and unite as one to fight climate change.
 <br><hr>
I agree with you that we need to take action and steps toward bettering our planet and working to reduce wildfires. I, like Olivia, had also experienced evacuation from a fire. I am from Sonoma County California and experienced the Tubbs Fire in the fall of 2017, which, like the Cave Fire from the film, “Fire in Paradise”, was also conspired to have occurred, or at least worsened, by PG&E power lines. I had to evacuate my home and school was cancelled for a week, but the most impactful aspect of this fire was the way that everyone came together to help one another after the Tubbs fire had happened. The film “Fire in Paradise” mentions that human caused climate change has doubled wildfires across the United States. If we could all come together like the citizens of Sonoma County did after the Tubbs Fire, to protect our earth, maybe we could stop the fires before they happen, or at least not aid to the sparking of them. It is not surprising to me that so many of these comments, including Olivia’s and multiple of the replies to her comment, involve people describing how they too have experienced evacuation or, at the very least, some sort of impact by a wildfire in California. As Ken mentioned in this video, four out of five of the latest wildfires in California history have happened in the past decade. Wildfires certainly do not pick and choose who they will hit - wildfires can affect the poor, the rich, the young, the old. Everyone in California should be wary of this issue, and work toward bettering the planet so we don’t experience any more disasters like the Tubbs Fire, the Thomas Fire, the Cave Fire, or any other wildfire in California in the past decade.


 <br><hr>
When someone has the actual experiences and is really in danger, their comments are more real and intense. After reading your comments regarding the film and your experience, I was quite emotional and had a such feeling that we must try to solve the problem to be safe. In retrospect to the time that Szechuan, a southern city in China, has suffered from a catastrophic earthquake in 2008, I heard some experiences from my friends in Szechuan. When they were in there, they has a such different feeling from those who just watched the tragic scene on TV. While they successfully escaped from the apartments, they saw it collapsed. They has such a panic fear after the accident, and they will never forget that feeling. Therefore, I can somehow understand the feeling that you had while facing the Thomas Fire which acknowledged as one of the biggest fire in California’s history. The government and residents need to cooperate to find a solution to change the situation to some extent. It is imperative that people contribute some to society to resolve their situation.


 <br><hr>
That is a really good point that you brought up. As the climate crisis becomes more violent and fires like the paradise fire become more common and frequent we are going to end up running out of places to go for safety. It is a scary thought to think about the fact that one day we may not have anywhere to go.
 <br><hr>
 I am so sorry that your friends had to experience that. It is sad because, unfortunately, there are a lot of people who have had to live through these crazy fires. I also agree with you that actually experiencing a fire first hand compared to watching it on your TV are very different. I find it difficult to explain exactly how I was feeling when the Thomas Fire took place. It is hard to put into words what you are feeling while you sit back and watch the town you grew up in, your home, burn down to the ground. No one should ever have to go through that. That is why it is so important to take action.

"Fire in Paradise" was a particularly captivating watch due in part by the emotional impact and intimacy of the subject matter. I am ashamed by how ignorant I really regarding the circumstances of the fire. I was aware of it and have heard/read snippets about it in the time that has passed, but I was truthfully, wholly unfamiliar when it came to the details and severity of the event. Therefore, the film was certainly a shock to the system and the normalcy of how I've been going on with my life while events like the wildfires in California have been happening. I appreciated the inclusion of personal stories and interviews with both civilians who were affected by the fire and those who were given the task of dealing with the devastation brought about by it. The interviews with the CalFire upper brass and local government staff in particular shed light upon the unfortunate circumstances that the people of Paradise and Concow. It also showed that when it comes to plans regarding climate disasters, just enough preparation and planning is clearly not enough anymore given the increasing severity of the disasters given new life in the climate crisis. There is no way of telling when circumstances similar to that of the Camp Fire happen again. However, it's existence shows that with the climate crisis in fruition, planning and preparation needs to go far beyond what many have in store at the moment. Each significant moment presented in the film was intertwined with a personal story that often also included personal footage taken during their situation. Jordan Huff's story regarding her grandfather was heartbreaking as the death of a loved one and the image left behind by the burnt wheelchair and garden hose created a truly emotional connection. This film will make me reconsider myself and my family's plans regarding natural disasters as I truly don't know how I will react when placed in a situation similar to Huff's. Each story in the film has made a dent in my heart that will continue to stay there for a long while.

Sadly, I can agree with you in the fact that I had heard very little about this fire/ didn't know the extent of its destruction. Before taking this class, I hadn't thought much about the correlation between climate change and the increase in wildfires in the past couple decades. It was heart-wrenching to watch the survivors' stories and the live footage of the evacuation. It is clear that the town did everything in their power to help keep the town safe, yet the intensity of the fire made them feel utterly hopeless as they sat on the freeway, trying to get away from it.

I completely agree with your statement and I also experienced the same eye opening experience as I finished watching the documentary. I also, being from the central valley, didn’t know how disastrous this fire was and wasn’t informed on the amount of homes and families that were destroyed. It truly changed my viewpoint on natural disasters and the steps to prevent this from happening again. After watching the documentary, my heart was touched and immediately wanted to know how I could help prevent something like this from happening again but didn’t make the connection between the climate crisis and this disaster until after watching Professor Ken’s video. I know now that if we continue what we are doing it will create more disasters like these since the climate is warming drastically. I think it was important to watch “Fire in Paradise” to open my eyes to what is happening around me and that in other places in the world situations could be far worse.

I think the Fire in Paradise film did an excellent job of demonstrating the magnitude of the fire and the issues that occured. While watching I was getting frustrated with the Cal Fire department for not giving the town of Paradise a better warning. Since Paradise’s evacuation plan required zonal removal they could have had an easier time evacuating than everyone last minute realizing they have to leave at once. The actual footage of the fires and everything completely burning to nothing, looked almost apocalyptic. Hearing the stories of each individual really helped portray how awful these fires are. People lost their homes, lost family members, and had no idea if they would even survive. When hearing Kelly’s story I could imagine myself fully surrounded by flames in complete panic.  It is so crazy that events like these are becoming our reality and are only going to get worse. I think the Cal firefighters underestimated the power of these fires, because the drought and heavy winds caused by climate change keeps getting worse to the point that firefighters cannot prepare for the rate these fires are able to spread at. I think going forward our fire department and evacuation plans need to be as cautious as possible when judging evacuations because the rates the fires are spreading out will just continue to get faster and bigger. 
<br><br>
The companies and people responsible for these fires need to be held accountable. PG&E knew that their lines were too old and could cause a fire, but they didn’t do anything about it because it would cost lots of money to repair the old lines. Their decision to ignore this warning is not acceptable because all of the destruction and lives that were lost were caused by this selfishness. Yet these big companies always get away with it. It also was astonishing to me that the Australia fire is 4 times the size of the largest 15 fires in California combined. Even just seeing the footage from the campfire and how much destruction caused was a lot, and that is significantly smaller than the acreage being destroyed in Australia. Hopefully we can figure out better prevention methods but as long as temperatures continue to rise, we can expect to see bigger, faster, and more frequent fires.

Being from Fresno, I’ve never had to worry about a fire. In fact if you look at a California fires map you will see fires don’t seem to threaten the Central Valley. So while watching this film I was astonished and terrified by the destructive nature of the Camp Fire. I was disgusted by the lack of communication between the civilians and the officials but I came to realize, there was no one to blame for this. Because of the dry and windy climate, the fire was spreading in all directions and no air support would’ve been safe to fly. Firefighters and police officers did everything they could do to evacuate the residents. To think these men were getting blamed for not doing a better job is absolutely absurd. If people have a problem they can take it up with climate change. 
<br><br>

The statement that really caught my ears throughout the whole film was “If PG&E was an individual and not a corporation, I think by now they’d be in prison.” To think that large corporations are not liable for their actions is infuriating. How can a company get away with the death of 85 people and the destruction of over one hundred thousand acres? I learned from the film, PG&E has this mentality of letting things “run until they break”-- break often meaning catch on fire. This coupled up with climate change is going to keep leading to mass destruction. Dry, windy climates are a perfect recipe for fire disaster.

Ken’s insight about how some populations view climate change as a distant issue reveals why some may not be referring to it as an urgent matter. Sadly, I can draw parallels to the woman in the documentary who refused to evacuate until it was too late. It’s like, out of sight out of mind kind of thing. Unless the fire is in your backyard, then climate change isn’t an issue. Unfortunately, I feel as though many climate change deniers have this outlook. 

<br><br>

I didn’t expect to like the film as much as I did, but I found the different viewpoints interesting and it gave me more background on what really happened with the Camp Fire. I remember hearing about it when it happened and I distantly knew someone who lost a house by consequence of the fire, but obviously, there’s no way I could have understood the severity of it. Hearing about Paradise’s residents’ experience evacuating the fire and seeing the fire footage is just wild and really puts me in a place to imagine what I would do in the chance of fire around Santa Barbara/Goleta. Overall, the film does a great job of including varying vantage points from victims to firefighters and it really fills in the viewer to what happened on November 8, 2018.

“It was a manageable looking fire if I could get to it.” these words would echo in my head and invoke sympathy that I did not know I had. In “Fire in Paradise,” Drea Cooper and Zachary Canepari give a detailed account of what took place on November 8, 2018. No one saw it coming, no one anticipated that such a small fire could spread so far and put so many people’s homes and lives in danger. There were many instances throughout the film where I thought I would cry because I felt like I was there, I felt like I knew the victims and I felt like I was next. Cooper and Canepari's ability to invoke such intense emotions through this film was astounding; it was a wakeup call for sure. Although this documentary does not address climate crisis specifically, it does center on this one event that could’ve happened to anyone. Anthropogenic climate change has doubled since the 1980s and its consequences are only getting worse. 
<br><br>

Before watching this documentary, I had only heard of wildfires through the news and had seen images capturing it on the internet. The video clips, interviews, audio calls gave me a completely different perspective because they put me in their shoes. What's scary is that wildfires have become somewhat common throughout California, but this one specifically was unexpected and fast and terrifying. There's no doubt that there could be more just like this one. "Fire in Paradise" did an insane job at depicting what happened that day, and the many emotions that people felt. While their inclusion of different people and what was going on in their heads when it happened, and the loved ones they lost were equally disheartening, there are many other stories out there just like theirs. If we don't make necessary changes in our lives, we may have a story of our own as well. and we shouldn't.

I completely agree. I remember hearing all about the Camp fire when it happened because I was living in Los Angeles and people talked about it a lot, not to mention it was everywhere in the media- however it wasn’t until I watched this film that I understood how horrific this event was. Originally, I was really confused about the whole evacuation because I saw so many videos of people in their cars surrounded by this fire, but this documentary was really helpful in breaking down what actually happened. I really think that the emergency relief teams did everything they could, and that’s precisely what makes this fire so scary.. Because they couldn’t control, it was so powerful. It’s so unsettling that emergency relief did everything they could and still despite all efforts the fire burned 153,000 acres and killed 85 people. Its deeply frustrating that Pacific Gas and Electric hasn’t been held accountable, and that people do not seem to see this fire as the massive warning it is. As climate change continues fires like this will happen more often and only become larger and more destructive- especially in California. It only took a matter of hours for the whole town of Paradise to be burnt to the ground, displacing thousands of lives- and living in california people must begin to realize that if things do not change course this could be the likely impact on anyone’s community or town. I feel deeply sad for those impacted by this fire, and I feel deeply sad for this planet.
<br><br>

Wildfires seem to be happening far more often than ever before, even reflecting back on this year a number of large monstrous fires have happened. Australia is burning as I type this.. and the amazon continues to be abused. Companies and industries responsible for these incidences must be held accountable for their crimes. It is pure negligence on their part and the whole world is paying the consequences.
<br><hr>
 I am in total agreement with you that these detailed accounts brought out anger and distress. Props to you for not crying because I was a sobbing mess the entire documentary. It's so heartbreaking to see that our actions have been so destructive to the environment. The fact that the firefighters were saying that these were not normal conditions with a normal fire is just mind boggling. I also haven't really seen the results of wildfires before this film, but I didn't expect anything like that. To see the carnage and lives lost literally hurt my soul. But then I was just angry because there are people out here that are so selfish and greedy that they don't care that their actions are detrimental to the lives of others.
<br><hr>
I agree when I heard him say those words it broke my heart, I could not imagine what it must have been like as an emergency responder that day not knowing what to do, and feeling like all you can do is try and get people out alive. The fact that there was poor communication and little knowledge as to what was happening must have been terrifying for those living there and hearing the 911 calls along with survivor’s stories made me emotional while watching this film. I enjoyed how they included real videos from both the survivors and other sources because it really helped to put the viewer in their shoes, I sat there watching wondering just how scared they must have been in those moments. It made me think, would I have been brave enough to run through fire, or could I have made it out if I was in that situation? I remember when this happened and I knew that the fires were bad, but until you actually see what it was like from inside and out of the fire do you truly understand how dreadful and frightening it was. I’m embarrassed to say that I had no idea they were this bad. This movie is very eye-opening and I hope more people take the time to watch it, what hurts more is knowing that if the energy company had just turned off the power this could have been prevented, but I understand sometimes things like this have to happen in order to get change which is unfortunate. The worst part is it is very clear these devastating fires are not going anywhere, they are going to occur more and more often because of climate change. Industries and companies need to take responsibility for their contributions to climate change and they need to start making changes if we want to stop having devasting events like this.

"Fire in Paradise" was the first film that I've watched about climate change that made me incredibly emotional. While watching the film, I couldn't help but put myself in the resident's positions and wonder what would happen if I was a resident of Paradise. I can't imagine how helpless emergency dispatchers, firefighters, and policemen felt throughout the whole evacuation disaster. I was not ready for real life recordings of the dispatch calls to be displayed in the film, I felt hysterical and had to stop the film for a bit.
<br><br>

Before watching this film, I did not realize how bad the Paradise fires were. This proves to show that we've become ignorant to natural disasters because they happen so often-- and we shouldn't be. Each natural disaster should make us want to change our ways and be proactive, not just pushing it aside because it doesn't affect our immediate life. I couldn't believe it when the film said that Paradise burnt in 4 hours, although authorities thought that the fire wouldn't even hit Paradise. Often times we are reliant on authorities to update us about correct information, but in the situation of Paradise, even the authorities were confused as to what's going on. Authorities need to come up with more ways to reach all residents, and residents need to evacuate if they feel like something's wrong. Watching this whole film, including the miscommunication and casualties, broke my heart.

This film also made me very upset. The stories that the people of Paradise were heartbreaking. I can't even imagine what was going on inside their heads. I have no idea what I would do if I was in their situation. I can't imagine running through fire without being able to see. I don't know if I would be able to leave my mom behind like that one girl did. The dispatch recordings gave me chills and I also had to pause the film. It was unbelievable that some people weren't even notified about the fire. They had no idea that they were in danger. I felt terrible for the dispatcher because she was told to tell the citizens that they had nothing to worry about and that the fire wouldn't reach them. If only she was informed better she could have helped more people get out sooner. 
<br><br>

I also didn't know the severity of the Paradise fire.  It wasn't talked about enough. I only saw it on the news. I never heard anyone actually talk about it. I agree with you that we have become desensitized to natural disasters when we really shouldn't be. The sad truth is that they are only going to occur more often and are going to be even stronger. We are going to be even more used to these natural disasters. After seeing the damage done by the Paradise fire I want to do whatever I can to help prevent catastrophes like that from occurring again. Hopefully, the Paradise fire was a wake-up call to everyone who still doesn't believe in the climate crisis. It is very much real and we are already seeing the effects of it. We need to start making a change before the fires in California get even worse. We also need to have better evacuation plans and better ways to alert people of the potential danger. More lives could have been saved if Paradise had a better communication system in place.

The film "Fire in Paradise" was a fascinating look into the worst fire disaster in California history. It gave details of how climate change played a role in this issue. Whenever I personally thought about climate change, I always pictured melting ice caps and rising oceans. However, I never really imagined fires. I now know that fires are a very real part of the changing climate, and are effecting peoples lives right now, not just the future. With all that is going on in Australia, I fear more of these issues in the future. I cannot imagine myself having to deal with this, and I feel so much sympathy for those doing their best to deal with it. I believe if more people became aware of the fire potential climate change has, they would be more motivated to act. Hopefully more information like this comes out and is disseminated so we can finally begin to act and prevent more disasters like these.

It’s very heartbreaking. Not only does it suck seeing everyone struggling to get out this place they call home, but it also sucks knowing that a lot of them tend to get mad the easiest person to go to. I completely understand though, as when a person is in as much shock and sadness and anger as they were, it’s very difficult to not find others to blame quickly. Unfortunately though, these people are usually the ones who are meant to try and protect and save us in the first place. It’s very hard trying to get through our heads that policemen, sheriffs, and firefighters aren’t all-knowing and are indeed humans as well. I liked that the documentary showed the interviews of the 911 dispatch employees, nurses, and firefighters that were just as confused as all the citizens because it gives a glimpse of these workers as humans first. It’s fascinating how much they try and how many lives they save, but it’s very easy for one to focus on the negative and think about what they didn’t do or could’ve done.  
<br><br>
By the end of the documentary, I was pretty confused and disappointed with PG&E and their selfish actions, but was glad that they explained that they now shut down their power in similar cases like these in order to not go through this again. It sucks that it had to happen in the first place for them to see it, but at least they learned their lesson. In this case, we should learn our lesson too. Not only do we have to prepare for these extreme cases with escape plans and such, but we also have to acknowledge that it’s primarily our fault and we gotta step it up. At the end of the day, one could be mad at whoever they want. But the fires are just going to get bigger and stronger and when we have no one else to point fingers at, the true monsters will be left to blame.

You know Ken, it's interesting you bring up that last statistic about the Australia fire and the immense span such a catastrophe is having. It goes along with what I was thinking when watching the "Fire in Paradise" film; we are seeing such incredible amount of life loss due to natural disasters like these wildfires like the Paradise Fire. Right off the bat the film begins with what seems like a broken man slowly crumble further as he recounts the day of the Paradise fire. When watching the film, I felt myself drawn in by the tense music and eerie interviewers couple'd with the images of an almost hellish landscape. Every single one of these people, no matter their age, race or political background, were had one simple goal in mind: survival. This is precisely the type of unbiased onslaught nature intends to retaliate with if our race continues down the self-destructive course we have charted.
<br><br>

Throughout the film, the subject of climate change and all that I have recently taken in was playing over and over in my head. The most astonishing thing was that these events are becoming a norm in the new century, not some fear that's off in the distance. Climate change is an a giant alarm right in front of us where there is no time to think about trivial and materialistic goals. To put it as one of the firefighters in the movie said, the advent of climate change is the new plume of black smoke in front of us. We know it's there, we know it's coming and the time is now to do something about it. 
<br><br>

It just pisses me off at that the big issue is centered around a few unearthly powerful schmucks who just don't care about the common man. We all end up in the dirt at end of the day, I just hope we can all come together while we're still alive to do something about it.

I am completely shell shocked by the proportions that these fires seem to be increasing by with each new one that occurs. While I was never in immediate danger from the Woolsey fire, I vividly remember seeing the flames and that haunting red glow from the beach in Santa Monica and how scary it was simply from its size. I can barely fathom the size of the Woolsey fire, and it doesn't even make the top 20 list for California wildfires. How is it possible that the current Australian fires are 4 times the top 15 Californian fires? I am simply unable to imagine it. To discuss the Paradise fire, the most intriguing part of the documentary was when the fire chief was asked if they should have predicted a fire of that scale. While the documentary may have had accusatory undertones to the first responders' plan of action, I believe that this fire wasn't predictable because of climate change, which makes these future fires so frightening. It is difficult to make models and predictions for the fires because of how our climate is changing, each year it gets hotter and hotter, directly affecting other environmental variables that act to manipulate the characteristics of wildfires. While I believe that the cause of the fire was PG&E's lack of responsibility, the change in climate that we face was what allowed the fire to get so out of hand, and led to so much destruction.

"Fire in Paradise" of the many things it does well as a documentary, really demonstrates the emotional toll natural disasters have on those affected. Personally I don't remember the fire very well but it doesn't surprise me that it came as a result of PG&E's equipment failure as they have been known for these type of events in the past. Something that stuck out to me was the contrast in the times that were listed during the documentary denoting how many hours it had been after the fire. This really showed how quickly the fire spread. The main spreading of this fire also took place during the morning but, had the film not had the time stamps I would've been convinced it happened during the nighttime due to all the smoke circulating through the air. 
<br><br>
One thing about the documentary that I did not like was when one of the reporters asked the fire chief of Paradise if he should've been prepared for a fire of that magnitude. I think he did the right thing by refusing to answer that question as it was an obvious attempt at the film to suggest that he and his crew could've done more when in reality preparing for something of that magnitude isn't possible as you have nothing to base off of. Also it seemed wrong to ask that question as he was part of the people responding and doing their best to help the residents of Paradise. 
<br><br>
Instead of acting like we should prepare for natural disasters of which magnitudes we have not seen before I think it is best we try and take preventative action in order to reduce the amount of "super-disasters" from occurring.

I completely agree with so many different points you brought up. While watching the film, I was distraught listening to the 911 calls like the three women who were stuck in their house and the police officer couldn't help them, he had to just move on. Also the different families that lost loved ones, such as Christina who tried to get her mom to leave the house and evacuate with her, but her mom insisted on staying and her body was found a few weeks later. These stories shattered my heart because it truly shows how the circumstances of this fire made it impossible to save everyone. The notifications for evacuation didn't get sent out to everyone because over half of the citizens of Paradise didn't sign up for them. And even with this, some people who had signed up for the notifications didn't receive one. Because of this, many of the people who perished in the fire were older than 65 and believed that the fire wasn't too big of a deal since they didn't receive evacuation orders from the police or fire departments. 

<br><br>

Another thing that I also noticed that you commented on was the fact that this all happened in the span of a few hours. By 7:45 am, the fire spread to the other side of the valley (closer to paradise) and at this point the fire was spreading at a rate of 80 football fields per minute. This statistic is literally insane to think about. Every minute the fire spread so much and it is all due to the negligence of PG&E. So many innocent lives were taken by this fire and no one was sent for prison. This angers me a lot because in many cases, the top leaders and CEOs of major corporations never get placed in prison, rather they get a fine. The amount of money they lost in damages doesn't compare in any way to the 85 innocent lives lost. 
<br><br>


I also agree with your point about how disrespectful it was for the reporter to ask the fire chief the question of if he should have been more prepared for that fire. He most likely went through so much trauma in those two weeks when he had to find bodies and help people evacuate. He and the rest of the firefighters and police officers did all they could to save as many people as possible. Obviously the communication between the officers and the residents could have been better because many residents didn't know the severity of the fire, but in every event of this magnitude, nothing will and can go perfect. In the end, they saved so many lives from this fire and did the best they could. There was a set evacuation plan from the 1990s that was renewed in the early 2000s, but they couldn't know that the fire would be that destructive and spread that fast.
<br><hr>
I agree with you on the fact that there was no precedence for a fire of this magnitude that the firefighters could base their preparations off of. This shows in the fact that they had devised multiple evacuation plans in the past two decades and that they failed miserably. The fact that their evacuation warning system was not something that everyone in Paradise was subscribed to shows a lack of proactivity but also a lack of anticipation for the need of this technology. The compounded effect of the narrow roads and the volume of people all trying to leave at once as a result of no previous evacuation led to higher death tolls. 
<br><br>


The disaster between the lack of planning and the lack of regulation on PG&E shows us that Murphy's Law is true - the worst things tend to be a convergence of terrible circumstances. Up until now, wildfires have been a regular, if not as significant occurrence, things that are usually maintained and that do not burn down entire cities. Climate change has changed the status quo. With longer fire seasons and more erratic weather, California will see more tragedies like this. I find it ironic that a power company (a large source for carbon emissions) was doubly responsible for the Paradise Fire - it contributed to the CO2 emissions that cause climate change, and it lended the spark to burn down tens of thousands of homes. 

<br><br>

Since it's only going to get worse, we need to stop or at least slow climate change, and radically change the way we prepare for natural disasters because we have not yet seen the worst of it to come.
<br><hr>

This documentary was well put together, and it portrayed the Camp Fire and its effects on the people that lived there extremely well. I do not think most people fully understood what happened during this fire; the film was a great insight into the events that transpired that day. I think it is films like these that will help persuade people that climate change is happening, and we need to take action.

<br><br>

The times placed on the screen also stuck out to me when I was watching the film, and it was terrifying how fast the fire had gained momentum. When I had heard about the Camp Fire, I knew it had destroyed the entire town, but I did not realize how quickly the fire had spread. It was tragic that all of these circumstances lines up to create such an unpredictable fire, and the climate crisis certainly did not help. There is no way that anyone could have predicted a something of that magnitude -- if this does not convince someone that climate change is hurting our planet I do not know what will. 

<br><br>

I also agree that it was unfair for the reporter to ask the fire chief if he should have seen a fire like this coming. There had never been a fire even close to the same as this one. How could someone predict something with nothing to go off of? I believe that the fire fighters did everything they could in regards to the fire and the safety of the residents. There was no reason to question and try to degrade him when he was out there trying to save people's lives; he should be given a huge thanks, not an accusation.

The film, “Fire in paradise”, gave us an insight about how severe the climate issues are and how terrible the consequence of our action can be if we do not take action to change this situation. The film was heartbreaking, I felt terrible for those people who were in danger. This fire could be prevented; actually, this whole thing could be prevented if people realized the consequence of climate change. 
<br><br>

At the first, I cannot ignore the fact that the whole catastrophe can be prevented if the electric company obeyed the rule and closed the power at the first place, nor can I not to say that if there was someone who can inform the people in the town the actual situation of the fire and let them evacuate sooner, or at least let them get prepared, the cost of this catastrophe can be less severe.
<br><br>

Nevertheless, I do agree that the climate change played an important role in this incident. In that period, the extreme weather acted as a catalyst that turned a normally controllable fire into a huge life-killing fire storm. According to the video, there was no rainfall within eight month and turned all vegetations into potential fuels for the fire. Additionally, the wind also was an important factor in this incident. The wind enabled the fire to cross the canyon in a high speed, and therefore, reach the town at the end. That was a catastrophe for people who lived in the town, but ironically those extreme weather with windy days are believed to be a consequence of the climate change.

Subjects like forest and wildfires always hit a little bit closer for me, as my dad has been a firefighter in Northern California for the past almost 30 years. Although we don’t live close enough to Paradise for him to be stationed there during the fire, I’ve seen the personal impact that firefighters and first responders are dealing with as a result of these ever-worsening wildfires, and even worse for the families, homes, and cities destroyed. It really tears the people who work so hard to protect us apart, and it just keeps happening more and more often. It destroys the environment, cities, buildings, homes, cars, nature, families and friends. I think the film does a good job capturing that this is not an easy thing to deal with for anyone, and it seems that everyone has something they feel guilty about, something they wish they could’ve done, something they wished they would have thought of. 
<br><br>


 Fire In Paradise does a good job conveying the emotional and personal problems caused by the fire, but considering the climate crisis, I felt that it wasn’t highlighted much for how significant it was in the cause of such fires. It was curious to me that the direct cause of the fire was not explicitly stated (at least not that I noticed), as I feel like stating the cause could be very helpful for viewers in preventing another event like this from occurring. I feel like the film had an opportunity to not only make this a film to tug at your heartstrings, but could’ve also provided more information for the viewers on how to stop this- they showed us all these sad stories but did not supply us with any resources to learn from/donate to/help with fire relief/learn about the climate crisis and how we are worsening it, which is why we are seeing more and more wildfires in California. 
<br><br>

 All in all, I found this film very personally and emotionally impactful, yet I feel that the filmmakers could have done more to share the science/reasoning behind why and how these wildfires are occurring. 
<br><br>
Sharing this information at the end of the film, I think, would have been very efficient in assisting people to become more educated on the many issues of the climate crisis and the many forms of destruction it takes.

I totally agree that everyone in the documentary felt guilty about something and they all think they should have done something differently to prepare better- which makes you realize that there's nothing we really can do in situations like this..how do you prepare for something that is unforeseeable, which makes the climate crisis a scary topic to keep ignoring. I also agree that I thought the documentary could have gone a little more into detail about preventative measures that caused the small fire in the beginning. They noted it was from the material from an old part on the pole or something, but other than that and the wind, I feel like the viewers were left a little in the dark about the beginnings of the fire...but maybe that is the point...no one really understood the beginning of the fire hence the lack of understanding about how to combat it. Which only reminds me that as Ken has said, we can't confront the climate crisis if we don't know about the issues first
<br><hr>

I agree with how important the climate crisis is in connection with wild fires. It is a big reason why the fires are spreading so rapidly. While the documentary was very emotional, hearing more about the climate crisis would be more effective to understand the overarching problem. Hearing about is problem is very different than learning how to solve the problem.

The film, "Fire in Paradise" was something very hard for me to watch being that I live 10 minutes from what was Paradise. Growing up in Chico, we always went up to the flumes there and swam in the swimming holes the small town offered, to know that the area was completely burnt into nothing will forever be hard. The fires affected everyone I know from home in some way, whether it meant they lost their childhood homes, schools, jobs, or land they owned. I remember being here at UCSB waiting for daily updates from my parents to see if they had to evacuate or not, going to bed dreading the idea that my childhood home with all my things would be affected by the spread of the fire too. We have always had forest fires, we have a huge park and a lot of land that is either used for agriculture or literally not used for anything except to just be land, so we are used to little fires here and there so this one wasn't a surprise when it began. What was surprising however, is how it was nearly impossible to maintain and how devastating it truly was. I will be honest, I did not finish the movie because it made me so upset to have to relive the situation in a way. Each summer, it seems that Chico gets hotter and drier each year, hitting at 110F some days, meaning that each year, we become more susceptible to these catastrophes. In turn, the lack of rain, dryness and the neglect of PG&E to keep their facilities and wiring up to date was just not a good mix for our region. I felt as if this documentary did a good job of telling the stories of Paradise residents and the story of how it happened itself. 

<br><br>

Though this documentary was more on the experience and effects of the fire itself and less about climate change, it brings up the idea of how a situation like this can affect ones perception on an issue. For example, Paradise is generally a very right-leaning region even though it is situated next to a blue Chico, meaning that many people take the partisan stance that "climate change is not real," I can't emphasize enough the countless times in which I heard people say "this region is always this hot, its just a placebo because they are telling you its getting warmer/drier." Like yes, it does get disgustingly hot in Butte County every year however, statistics don't lie. We have doubled the amount of wildfires a year since the 1980s, thats extremely scary and not at all normal if it's the "same every year." This occurrence really opened the eyes of climate-change deniers in our area and definitely pushed many over to advocate for climate justice and more eco-friendly forms of electricity (such as solar) in the region.

This film was a very good example of how intense fires get.  The fires are getting more intense due to climate change.  I thought that the first thing that the firefighters did was a rescue and not to put out the fire or to strategize how to put it out was scary.  The fire had been too intense that they could not focus on putting it out but save people first.  
 <br><br>

The film made me realize how in the dark the 9-1-1 operators are at the beginning of reports.  Many operators were saying that they know the fire is in one place but other callers are reporting another place and the callers were scared and asking if they should evacuate and the operators would just tell them not to because it was not a danger to them at the moment.  The operators were told by the fire department that the fire was in another area, so they were confused about why so many were calling about a different area of the fire.  I thought this was crazy because some of those people that called about evacuating and were told not too and then when they had to evacuate there was not enough time ended up not making it.  If the operators had told them to evacuate when they called they could have been fine and survived the fire.  I was surprised to know that the fire department does not have a way to evacuate a city without evacuating them in zones but not all at once.  Now after the tragic events, more knowledge has come with the experience and has different strategies to evacuate a city.  I found that the way of communicating the evacuation to the city was annoying.  They said that people had to sign up to receive the evacuation notice and only those who signed up got the notification.  I feel like in a city that is probable to fire then every household should be mandatory signed up to receive the notification.  This should not be a choice because it does not take anything away from city households.  They simply just receive a notification and it is not like they are going to be getting these notifications every day living there but only in times of potential danger.  I think that most people would agree with this living in Paradise.

I watched this video in the library and it was so hard for me not to start crying. The effects this fire had were so devastating and must have been terrifying as someone who lives in paradise. Listening to the stories of the people involved made me realize just how terrifying the whole event was. The fire started as just a small manageable area that firefighters just couldn’t get to. Imagine if the road had been just a little wider or the wind was not so strong. This could’ve saved lives and homes. I lived only a couple hours away from Paradise and I remember the smoke that filled the air. At that time I never realized what was really happening in Paradise.
 <br><br>
There’s one thing that really upset me about these fires. The lack of evacuation notice caused chaos. The evacuation should’ve been stated much sooner and to many more people. The plan wasn’t very effective and with only a few ways out the authorities should’ve known to release an evacuation before the fire even began to threaten Paradise. I think the worst part to me was when the man at the end was asked if there was a way to get the evacuation notice out he kind of ignored the question. Instead, he just said that it was hard to get people to evacuate already with that many cars, almost like he wouldn’t have sent out more evacuation notices so that there would be fewer cars. I really think there could have been fewer lives lost if authorities had gotten the info out sooner.

<p>
From the first people that are interviewed, it is sad that they were so sure it was just a normal fire and wouldn’t threaten Paradise. However, it got bad real quick. Firer fighters said that the fire was burning as badly at night as it was during the day so there was no way to get ahead of it. People have to realize that this weather activity is becoming the new normal because of climate change. The weather is driving these fires and new records are being set every year. There was no way for the people of Paradise to prepare for something like this. They lost pets, photo albums, friends, family, their houses and so many other things that we often take advantage of having and don’t realize how important it is to use until it’s gone forever. The people of Paradise called it a death of the life they had and that is truly heartbreaking. I don’t know how some people can recover from their whole life being taken from them in such a short amount of time. Families were left with no jobs no homes, I don’t know where you start from after that. I enjoyed watching the documentary because I didn’t realize how devastating the fire really was. I knew that it affected many peoples lives but I didn’t know that so many people died or were on the cusp of death so many times. It was very eyeopening and I am glad that I had the opportunity to be better educated on something that happened in my home state and that there is a possibility it could happen to my city in northern California.

The film “Fire in Paradise” took me on a rollercoaster of emotions as it expertly cut between the testimonies of the victims of the CampFire and the devastating imagery and videos of the fire itself. I was heartbroken and emotional when the survivors shared their last day in paradise and their stories about the friends and family they lost from the fire. The 911 calls were also a shocking and horrifying glimpse into the desperation of the citizens of Paradise as the fire plowed through the town. The film included actual footage filmed by individuals who were dispatched to contain the fire and also footage filmed by regular citizens on their phones. These video clips were crucial in bridging the gap between the viewer and the event of the CampFire. During the burning of Paradise, I was in school and had read about it on the news. People around me were talking about the “most devastating wildfire in California” and many people were pointing out the phrase “Paradise is on Fire.” I was very disconnected from this event because I had not seen actual images or videos of the people being affected. It was easy to write it off as another wildfire event out of the many that had been happening the past few years. I am so glad that this documentary was included in the course because I learned many lessons from this film and gained a much better understanding of what really happened on November 8th. 

 <br><br>

 I was very frustrated by the fact that there were so many people at fault for the loss of Paradise. PG&E is the first point I would like to tackle. This electricity company should take most of the blame because of their decision to allow their old power lines to continue standing in an area surrounded by a dry forest. Clearly, PG&E did this to cut down costs and save money. It is exactly this kind of greed from corporal companies that is putting lives in danger and supporting the climate crisis. The CampFire and the displacement of thousands of people is a clear warning and red flag directed at big corporate companies to stop thinking about the money when thousands of people and the climate are at stake. Next, it was frustrating how the roads were completely inaccessible for the thousands who were trying to escape because of the lack of funding in infrastructure by the county. While I agree that many people could not have predicted a wildfire as dangerous and fast-spreading as the CampFire, I do not think that these people shouldn’t be blamed. There has been evidence for years that the climate crisis is causing “global weirding” as temperatures rise and unpredictable weather is picking up. Since scientists have been saying this for years, the managers of the infrastructure in Paradise and the people in charge should have tried to put in effort to make preparations for the unpredictable. The lack of a proper warning signal of evacuation for everyone in the town is also inexcusable. What is the point of having an evacuation plan if not everyone in the town, more than half, cannot receive the Code Red signal? 

 <br><br>

 Overall, I was extremely moved and heartbroken from watching this documentary. I am both frustrated and saddened to see how thousands of people lost their homes because of big corporations and people in power who lack the knowledge on the topic of the climate crisis. I believe that the CampFire should be seen as an important lesson for everyone around the world to start focusing on wildfire prevention and preparing for the unpredictable effects of the climate crisis.

I very much agree with many of the points in your comment. As someone who lived relatively far away from the area of the fire, I was also quite disconnected with the idea of the devastating wildfire. I also gained much more understanding and sympathy for the people that were involved in the fire. This documentary also served as a reality check for me, in a way. We are people that are similar to those who were presented in the documentary. Just like them, we feel safe where we are and when we see news about wildfires such as this, we usually just dismiss the news without realizing that this could happen to us, too, at any moment. Climate change has impacted the whole world quite drastically, and we are not an exception. We could all easily be those people in the documentary who have lost loved ones, or even died. If we don’t take action to try to help the earth, I believe it won’t be long before we, and possibly a lot of the world, will face the same consequences. 
<br><br>
 I also agree with the second part of your comment, where you addressed that there were many people to be blamed for this incident. PG&E was highly negligent about the status of their powerlines, creating a fire hazard. Law enforcement did not take the idea of such a big wildfire happening seriously, and failed to have safety precautions to keep people safe in such an event. However, I also think that, in a small way, we are all to be blamed for the tragedy that happened at Paradise that day. For years, people have been hearing of climate change and its consequences, yet as residents of this earth, few of us have done anything to alter our lifestyles to try to fix things. Wildfires are not uncommon, and the only reason why this one has reached this extent is because we have failed to take climate change seriously. Yes, we can blame law enforcement for not having a solid plan to escape a fire of such extent, but a fire of such extent probably would not even have occurred if we had done something to fix our contribution to climate change. Instead of focusing on evacuation plans and fixing infrastructure so that they could last through more natural disasters, I believe things like fossil fuel industry and the meat industry should be addressed and dealt with to prevent events like this from ever even occurring again.

I think the important thing to not here is that the severity of these fires is what is notable. Due to changes in precipitation and increasingly dry summers, there is far more flammable brush that lead to more severe fires. 
 <br><br>
The increasing amount of disaster level fires is a severe side-effect of climate change that we are increasingly seeing across California. I also found the victim testimonials terrifying. The complete sense of helplessness gave me anxiety, and I can't imagine what those people went through. 
<br><br>
I played football against the Paradise football team and it was truly a beautiful place. I have since read articles on how the town is rebuilding and staying resilient. It is awful what happened to these people but it serves as a reminder to always be prepared.

The fire in Paradise, even though it was far away from my hometown of San Jose, I was still affected by it’s flames. Last year I school was canceled, water polo games and homecoming events were all postponed because of the smoke from these fires. I’m truly astonished to see how frightening it must have been to experience this fire. The sky was black at 9 am. What started the fire was a 100 year old power line that fell and sparked a brush fire, this combined with dry, high winds and hot temperatures culminated in a powerful “never before” seen fire. I feel terrible about the people who lost their lives in the fire and friends and family who lost loved ones. New alert systems didn’t alert everyone to evacuate so some lost their lives because it was too late. Escape routes were clogged and this caused cars to catch fire and people lost their lives. The current escape route seemed good enough for the average fire but now the average is changing. 
<br><br>
 This video highlights how we need to start preparing for chaotic natural disasters because these events are already here. Yes, we need to stop GHG emmissions but we also need to start preparing for horrific events because these are now the new norm.

I think your comment is a really important one to read over, and the point you make in the end is something we should all absolutely be thinking about. While this film does not exactly focus on the wide range of the climate crisis like we have been focusing on in this class, I feel that it is an extremely important film to watch. This is because many are not able to visualize the real effects this climate change is having in our backyard. Rather than using this platform to solely inspire change, this film serves as a reality check for those of us in danger zones today like Southern California. 
<br><br>
The reason your comment really stuck out to me was the realistic outlook you have on the issue. Sometimes rather than making ineffective, offensive attempts to stop a problem before it occurs, it is more beneficial to play defensively and prepare for them to strike. Although preventing it may seem much more ideal, realistically, being prepared for disaster may be more effective in saving lives and homes in these cases.

I was quite literally blindsided by “Fire in Paradise.” Initially, I was thinking that it was just another documentary that I had to watch for class. The entire episode had my eyes glued to the screen. It was disheartening to know that I hadn’t heard of this fire even though it was in California and I live here. Typically, I never think of fires as being a cause of deaths; seeing an entire town completely wipe out in a matter of hours was something that I did not expect. 
<br><br>
I particularly felt sorry for the individuals that survived, but had lost their loved ones. Although the start of the fire was due to the negligence of PG&E, it was aided by the effects of climate change. That’s the worst part. The long droughts and heavy winds contributed to the death of 85 people that were simply going about their day. By the end of the fires, cars, houses, and buildings were burnt to a crisp. Hearing people’s personal stories and how they were surrounded by fire with no way to escape is something you see in movies, not real life. How can this be our new reality? The amount of natural disasters have increased rapidly because of climate change. It’s no longer a debate nor is it subjective opinions, it’s facts. There is statistical and concrete data that we can no longer ignore or run away from. To think that it’s only going to worsen if people don’t recognize this terrifies me.

I truly feel the same as you. When I watch the film, I was completely surprised by the wildfire. The scenes in the film is very vivid, and it's so realistic that I even hold my breath. Also, in the video, the professor's experience and the news about the Australia wildfire trigger my feelings. First, I was astonished by the speed of the growth of the wildfire. I used to believe that wildfire is disastrous not by its speed of growth, but by the smoke of it. Now I can tell why so many people cannot escape from and die in the wildfire. With such limited time to response, it is extremely lethal. One of my friends in LA said that his house even burned by the wildfire. In addition, the professor said about the wildfire recently happened in Australia, I google it just then and I am truly feel sad for them. What triggers me the most is the koala was burnt furless and rolled up in a hole on the ground, waiting for someone to save him. By the time I saw it, I was thinking that why the nature is so cruel to us, but when I think about the reason of these disaster, I find out that these are actually cause mostly by human. We did the wrong things and we even drag other life beings into it to pay for what we did. I feel truly sorry for what human did....

I felt the same way when I was watching the documentary. I knew that I had heard about the fire in Paradise when it was going on, but I never truly understood the extent of it. It shocked me to hear that 85 people were killed in this fire and when some of the 911 operators were expressing the guilt they had because they couldn't help them, I felt the same way and I think we all should. As you said, the fire was not completely PG&E's fault, but it was also with the combination of the human caused climate crisis going on right now. I feel as if we all should have a little guilt over the destruction that the Campfire created because we are the ones who created the climate crisis. I'm thinking to myself, "Is this really what we have come to as a society?" and "Why are we letting people burn alive?". It's absolutely terrifying that we have to battle these horribly intense fires. 
<br><br>


You had a really good point about how "Fire in Paradise" shows the facts about how the climate crisis is here and how "we can no longer ignore or run away from" it and I also thought that this was the point of the film. As professor Hiltner states, this documentary does not really talk about the issue of climate change but it does illustrate how severe this crisis actually is. But, they do talk about how the combination of drought, high winds, and high temperatures have created much more catastrophic fires in the past years. A climate change scientist, Patrick Gonzalez, states, “Human caused climate change has doubled wildfires since 1984 across the western United States above what would have burned without climate change”, which illustrates that climate change is the reason for these devastating fires. 

<br><br>

Regarding the role that PG&E had in this fire, I had a thought that their lack of action represents humans lack of action to save the rapidly warming earth. Individuals referred to PG&E's inability to get new and safe equipment as reckless, because it obviously led to the destruction of an entire town, but doesn't this sound very familiar? Isn't our actions as a whole very reckless because it is leading to the destruction of the entire world? I feel like by showing what Paradise looked like after the fire and describing it as a kind of "doomsday", gives all of the viewers a glimpse of what everyone's reality is  going to be very soon, if not now.

This document “Fire in Paradise” mainly introduce the huge forest fire in 2018 in Santa Barbara. I heard UCSB canceled final into take home final. Before studying in California for college, I never met forest fire. I remember last fall quarter, I met first forest fire during Thanksgiving, and all the course were canceled. And one of my professor’s house on the mountain was destroyed by fire. I cannot imagine one day I need to wear mask go outside in America. Recently, everyone is watching the Australian forest fire incident. Many people feel pity and sad about death of thousands of Koalas. Nowadays, I believe most people have already the severity of forest fire. The reason causes forest fire is climate change. If we do not take action to protect environment and stop or defer the process of climate change, absolutely not alarmist, more stronger fires will destroy more life and wildlife.

<p>
What was crazy to me was how much miscommunication occurred in the first few hours of the Camp Fire. For many of the residents of Paradise, they mentioned that they never received an evacuation alert but it seemed to be because people who hadn't signed up for code red, didn't receive alerts. If the residents knew about code red and would like to know when some disaster is happening why did they not sign up? Also, it raised questions for the other side of those alerts; why did the county decide to use a system that only half had signed up for instead of something else that could alert everyone. Regardless of their alert system, it was devastating to think about the many people who called into 911 when they first saw the fire and were told there is nothing to worry about so they believed they did not need to leave there house, some of who would be consumed by the fire within their home. 
<br><br>


While it's unfortunate that not everyone was alerted, it was also devastating to watch these small-town roads being engulfed in flames and people being so unaware of where to go and what they can do. It makes me think that if people were alerted sooner there would have been less traffic and made it easier to escape, however, the fire was insanely rapid and no one was prepared for a fire that size and at that speed. What's even more horrifying, is that with the temperature steadily increasing, these kinds of fires will become more common. Let's hope that we can somehow be prepared.

I do agree with what you have said. The part that scares me the most and is the craziest is to hear how people were just so unaware of how serious the fire could actually happen when people called 911 but instead their calls were not being taken seriously. Not only that people didn’t expect such a serious fire could happen, but they are lack of an efficient system to alert people and to have a clear plan on how to evacuate people. The biggest warning arise from such a fire incident is to tell us how bad our climate is changing and how is it affecting our environment and causing serious disaster take away so many people’s lives. I think it is not something to be joked about and is time to take real action.
<br><br>
Aside from what you have mentioned, one thing I learnt is how small and weak humans can be when we are facing natural disasters, especially when I watched the part about the lady called 911 and was asking for help because she got trapped in her house and couldn’t escape at all and end up dying in the fire. We might think we are the victims in the incident, it is, but on the other hand, such a disaster happened because of the changes in our climate and environment are in some part caused by human activities. So I think humans are the only one that can make changes to it and prevent it from getting worse and prevent the same thing to happen in the future.

Fire in Paradise really freaked me out - both because of the devastating consequences it had on Paradise and because of how real and current it actually is in comparison to the fires happening in Australia as I write this. It was terrifying to watch the fires destroy Paradise, but even more terrifying to realize that this is happening as I watch for an entire continent, and it never seems to register until you actually see it yourself. Thank god for the media in that aspect - allowing other continents to see the devastating impact that Australia is suffering through.
<br><br>

But at the same time, it still never seems to be enough to shake our society to the core to make change. The way the climate crisis is talked and dealt with is a lot like gun control in a way - we have a devastating mass shooting that kills people, we send our thoughts and prayers for about a week or so and then go back to living our lives and forgetting the impact that many people still suffer. It is only when it directly affects us, that we suddenly jolt into reality and realize what is going on, and how negative it is. The climate crisis is a lot like that because although we know of what's going on in Australia, its never really registering. It's easy to post a story for donations online, but its harder to actually see it as a tangible and concrete thing that is happening NOW. We get so caught up in our own lives that we fail to realize this, until we are struck by a similar issue. 
<br><br>

I don't want to think that this means our society lacks empathy, but I do think that it points to a narrow-minded way that we look at the world and what happens in it. I think that with talking about the climate crisis, it is this huge problem that is hard to grasp at times. How can I, a third year at a college, really make people stop emitting greenhouse gases? Sure, I can vote for politicians to do that, I can protest and involve myself in social activism against it. But even with all this work, its hard for myself to truly make an impact. I don't want to sound like a pessimist by saying this. But I think underneath the climate crisis is more so a crisis of humanity and how we talk about, deal with, and help others with trauma, like that of the fires in Paradise and Australia. It's more so about re-attaching ourselves to humanity, after decades of desensitizing serious issues of the world and detaching ourselves from their own experiences (which as a human race, we should view as a collective devastation to our world).

This film also scared/freaked me out the same way. I was absolutely shocked to see the fires in Paradise destroy everything in its way in just a few hours. While watching this film, my friend and I thought about the fires happening in Australia. The film showed the raw emotion behind the traumatic experience of surviving a fire on a very personal scale, yet when thinking about the massive scale of other fires, such as the current ones in Australia, the detrimental effects of these fires are all the more shocking. I believe that it is very helpful that the media is able to cover the Australian fires so other continents are able to see the mass destruction that is happening there. This media coverage allows for fundings to take place and people outside of Australia to be aware of the damage being done. 
<br><br>
I was also wondering why Ken assigned this film while watching it considering the fire started from a power line. After watching his video though, it made much more sense as to why he assigned it. This film did a great job at showing how deadly these fires are because it allowed us to see how these natural disasters affect those who lived through it. I always knew that these fires were terrible and caused mass destruction, but it’s so different to actually see it on film. It scared me to see the people struggling to try and escape the fires. It also broke my heart at the end of the film when two different people explained how their loved ones died during these fires. I could never imagine going through what these people did and losing everything in the fire. It absolutely shocked me when the film showed an image of Paradise from a plane and everything was destroyed. There were no houses or cars untouched by the fires. One of the main things that also shocked me from this film was that the fire destroyed Paradise within 4 hours. When watching the film, I thought the fires took place within a span of a couple days, but was surprised when I heard it only took 4 hours. A fire that took 4 hours to destroy all of Paradise took a couple weeks to put out.
<br><hr>
I agree when you say that we usually only pay attention to mash shootings and natural disasters for ~a week. This is why I think Ken decided to make us watch this movie. Now, every time I hear about a forest fire or natural disaster, I'll think back on this movie. The story of Camp Fire and the residents of Paradise was told entirely through first hand accounts, making it much more hard-hitting. I now know exactly what the cops, firefighters, and residents are going through in these disastrous situations. Natural disasters from now on will not just be a article or section on the news, but real people going through traumatizing situations. It was difficult to empathize with survivors to the full extent they deserve, but after this watching I feel I have at least some grasp of what these people are going through. 

<br><br>

You say that you don't know how you can help the environment as an individual. This hopeless mentality is what makes the climate crisis such a difficult problem to solve. I see a lot of people not bothering to make an effort because they believe their actions have no consequence. No individual can completely change the world, but people collectively changing their attitudes is what will. One of the best things to do is encourage friends or family making environmentally conscious decisions. This will create a culture that promotes environmental friendliness. I believe this is what will ultimately end the climate crisis.

I was not expect this documentary can change my point of view on global warming so significantly. Although everyone lives in California knows that we get a big fire every year, it gradually become normal for us. It is a sad truth that we are accepting this. Although I read news about the fires, it was so shocking that these survivals, pictures and videos are so vivid. I could not stop imaging what if I am one of them? What would I do? The only answer is nothing. If anyone of us is involved in that situation, we can really do nothing. Just like the firefighters said "all the human tools does not work for this fire." and the police officer said " After the helicopter pour some water and it did not work at all, I realized it is a situation we can not fix it." When I watch the videos from the survivals, it is no difference from these disaster end of the world movie. The movie "2012" is happening right now. The negative effects of the global warming is showing and it is get worse and worse. It is sad we are taking this into a normal situation, the consequences will be unimaginable if we do not take actions now. Maybe 50 years later, if we do not take actions and we cause the end of world issue. At that moment, if we flash back to 2010s and 2020s we will realized all these fires are the symbols but we choose to ignore that. Imaging how sad that situation would be. This documentary completely changed my mind, it teaches me that if the disaster comes, we as human can not do anything. The only thing we can do is prevent it before it comes.

Watching the film reminded me a lot of the Tubbs Fire, which was the second most deadliest fires, right after Campfire, that occurred in my hometown. Like the Campfire, the Tubbs fire was also caused due to PG&E's negligence of their power lines. It was a windy day, like in Paradise, and a brush caught fire at night in which the sky glowed orange. Another similar thing that happened was the alerts that should've been sent out. There were no Amber Alerts or any sirens. The CODE RED, like explained in the documentary was the only way to get alerts, which proved ineffective since a majority of the town was not signed up. Traffic was also a huge problem when it came to evacuating. Our lanes are rather narrow like Paradise. Hearing the stories of the Campfire shocked me. Being able to relate to it is really different than from hearing it on the news. 

<br><br>

Something that shocked me most in the film was hearing stories of the victims of the fire. The 911 operator was only relaying the info that CalFire was giving to her. If I were in her shoes, I would feel guilt not being able to tell them the real destruction that the fire was about to cause. Because she was informed that the fire was in no threat to the town of Paradise, she wasn't able to properly warn the residents in time that a threatening fire was approaching them at an alarming rate.

I too, have personally experienced a fire due to the carelessness of PG&E. A few years ago I lived in a remote area deep outside of the city limits and with one small dirt road as the only way in and out. For almost a year, my mother and I took pictures every day of a ginormous tree that was leaning toward our road, and right above a PG&E power line. We sent these pictures to PG&E, hoping that they would take down this tree that was leaning more and more every week and posed as a major fire hazard. Eventually, they hired a specialist to come look at the tree in person and assess whether or not PG&E would pay to have it removed. After measuring the tree and observing the state of its roots, the specialist told my mother that the company would not take down the tree unless it was physically touching the power line, meaning it would have to be leaning at roughly a 45 degree angle with the road. This was completely absurd. Of course soon enough, we got a phone call saying the driveway was on fire, that the tree had fallen on the line, and it had ignited a fire that was spreading along the power line and simultaneously lighting different areas on fire. Thankfully, firefighters were able to control the fire quickly and efficiently, but I will never forget how PG&E directly ignored a safety hazard that could've threatened lives.
<br><br>


Watching the film "Fire in Paradise" reignited my hatred for the billion dollar corporation. This huge corporate business has ignored safety violations and created hazards that have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, and more, This is utterly disgusting. The Paradise fire was solely caused by the carelessness of PG&E, and the fire took the lives of 86 innocent people. As was pointed out in the film, if this damage was caused by a singular person, they would be in prison. Furthermore, I can't believe that their best solution to prevent fires is to shut off power to entire communities for days on end, wasting numerous resources and further endangering people. PG&E needs to be held accountable.

In the film Fire in Paradise, we see the most destructive fire in California's history and how people react to this disaster. I was shocked after I saw the film, because the fire is far beyond my imagination. The situation is much more severe than I thought before, especially after I saw images of devastating fire. In the documentary, people who have experienced the fire are interviewed. When they talked about what they went through, I felt like I was there and experienced the same thing as they did. Their description of the fire is so terrible. People talked about their family and how they suffered. They cried and I shared the same feeling with them, too. I don't regard climate change as such a severe problem until I watch this film. I am astonished by the serious consequences of the fire, which is the result of global warming. The film is an alert that warns us to pay attention to the situation.

In the film of Fire in Paradise, I think the special point of this documentary is it reflect on what did people do during the fire and fight against the fire. I totally agree that this fire, being the most destructive fire on the history of California, made us audience and authorities who dealt with it at time to realize how weak human beings really are facing the power of nature. We can hardly change anything while being fronted with the fire that devours everything it encounter. Take the case of wildfire now happening in Australia, seeing how animals are suffering from burns on their litter shaking bodies, the trees that are hundred years old fell down easily everywhere the fire touches, and people, who caused the climate crisis in some degree which in turn made the fire stronger, are fighting all their best to get them out of the danger, just every picture from Australia made me sad. We should do more to avoid this decades ago, we really should have to back then.

If you have the time, please view the aerial shot from 44:30-43 in the documentary “Fire in Paradise.”  
 <br><br>

When I first saw the scene I asked that you watch above, I immediately thought of how much the ashes of homes resembled burial plots at a cemetery. I had to pause the documentary and take a moment to process what I was seeing. Where rows of headstones would be at a cemetery, the streets of Paradise were filled with ashes where the homes used to stand. This documentary did a great job and brought light to the devastating aftermath of California’s largest wildfire. 
 <br><br>

Aside from the devastating photos and stories that were shown in the documentary, I was conflicted on whether to be mad at PG&E for not taking care of the electrical towers, the officials for the lack of proper evacuation protocols, or humans for contributing to climate change that played a role in this fire. Now that I am able to process everything, I realize that my anger means nothing since it can not bring back the homes and lives lost, and it certainly cannot reverse the present destruction of the climate. Being angry at the world and past generations will do nothing, but taking action actually will.

<p>
At first glance, you wonder how can a fire be so devastating and affect so many lives when people just run at the first sign of trouble? Do we not believe that human instinct would guide us to flee. Yet, when you watch the documentary, “Fire in Paradise”, the audience can see a holistic view of how this monumental fire can endanger the same amount of land as the city of Chicago. 

 <br><br>

I think that it is proper to begin identifying the root causes of the problem with PG&E, the electric company with towers and cables ranging across Paradise. We hear that before the film, there were heavy winds that may have caused the towers to fall or for the cables to be complicated. Yet, we realize that PG&E made no such action, believing that the winds were going to quickly dissipate and that there were no high-level threats. At the film’s end, we discover that an outside contractor reviewed and analyzed their towers, determining that they were much older than policy mandated and advised them to renew or replace. Yet, PG&E was convinced that they continued to work, therefore, keeping the towers in place. But, it was more than obvious that those towers were not up to code. I believe that PG&E played just as big of a part in this catastrophe as did any other player, factor, or circumstance that one could point fingers to in this scenario. They failed to understand the ramifications and consequences that a populus could face if a fire or any other natural disaster like that were to occur, but they chose for profit that they keep everything as is. 

 <br><br>

What I also find interesting, however, are the opinions of the firefighters, first responders, and policemen on call that day. Towards the end of the documentary, we hear that this plan was considered “successful” by some because of the result that could have panned out if personnel had not responded the way they did. Throughout the film, we see evacuation binders, 911 responders, and whole lists of preventative measures that could have been set in place, but when many were asked if they had anticipated a fire like the one on November 8th, most either declined to answer, swerved the question, or simply stated that no one could have predicted a fire of this magnitude. So, how do we constitute what was successful in this scenario?
 <br><br>


One person who felt that the firefighters, policemen, and the rest of the personnel failed them was Christina Taft, who forcefully tried to convince her mother to leave the house, but due to an absence of government-mandated evacuation announcements and warnings, refused to leave. After the fires had calmed, her body was found in the house of the living room she refused to leave. A huge aspect that victims of the fire can be attributed to is the lack of a warning system. Yes, excuses can be made that people failed to sign up for the system, or that it was difficult to determine which areas to communicate to. However, if there are evacuation plans for every county, there needs to be some sort of signal or message that can be sent to the public involved in that security measure. 
 <br><br>


I believe that the people who responded that day did the best they could. Would I call it successful? I am not sure. Yet, I do know that this heat was unprecedented, but well-predicted due to the ever-drying climate and the increasing temperatures throughout the world. However, today, we must learn from experiences as such and modify policies in order to prepare for the worst, even if it is outside our wheelhouse of possibilities. I think the way we respond to further fires, catastrophes, and such will truly determine how successful this was.

I grew up and lived in a small town about 45 min away from paradise. I always viewed it as this tight knit community surrounded by beautiful trees. I remember the morning of the fire, I had gone to school and heard about the fire by word of mouth. Nobody really took it seriously, it was just a “small fire.” Until hours later into the school day the sky was so grey and smokey. I knew people (including a teacher of mine) who lost loved ones and their homes due to the camp fire. The camp fire affected my school and town and neighboring towns and schools as well. Schools were cancelled for weeks because the air quality was so horrible nobody could breathe outside without masks. That just shows you how big the fire was because we lived about 45 min - an hour away from paradise. After watching the documentary, it is astonishing to me that human caused climate change has doubled wildfires since 1984 across the western United States and the temperatures in northern california have increased. To hear about the fires in Australia is absolutely heartbreaking. They are losing so many of their native animals and land. I believe I read somewhere that only 5% of the Koala population is left. They are on the brink of extinction. It’s truly depressing. As a young student in this class I want my generation to do better. This is our chance to become educated on the climate crisis and prevent it from getting worse than it already has gotten.

Hearing this from someone who experienced the effects of this fire themselves really helps in understanding how the effects of climate change aren't just what you see in the news or in stories but it is what happens to the "tight knit communities surrounded by beautiful trees" that we all know and love. I think that people have this thought that nothing bad will ever happen to them and thats the reason we don't take these events seriously when they arise. We also think that there are always superheroes in the world who will protect us no matter what happens and we truly take advantage of these real life superheroes like firefighters who are the ones who keep the world standing. Soon however, this crisis will be out of their control too and then what? There is no reason to have to rely solely on these brave people to fight for the cowards of the world who cannot do their part in keeping the planet at least livable, let alone thriving. 
 <br><br>

Like you said, our generation needs to do better. Our generation needs to pick up the slack of where the previous people left the world off at because we have the power, we have the resources and we have the knowledge to do so. The least we can do is bring the world back to a state where wildfires aren't occurring at double the rate. Our generation is the only answer because without our help, no one else will even be given the chance because the world will not be habitable.

To be honest, this is the only one documentary that really stirs at my heartstrings. The videos taken by people during the fire scared me. Various factors contributed to this horrific disaster: PG & E's ignorance of problematic transmission lines, infeasible escaping route, untimely notification, and people's carelessness. The powerful wind spread fire to larger regions, with everything burned around. When watching the scenes videoed by firefighters, I could clearly feel the despair as I was there. Some poor people were trapped in such hell with ashes falling down and heavy smoke, and they died. In addition to afraid, I also feel angry and ashamed. Humans themselves caused the whole disaster. Because of the climate change, we now doubled the occurrence of wildfire. More ironically, even sometimes we were proud of our advance technology, the  wildfires needed to be totally put out with the power of nature—the rain. However, the temperature of our planet is increasing and the climate is dryer and dryer. We are now suffering the horrible outcomes of our past behavior. Ken's video mentioned the wildfire in Australia now. It is much more serious than any fires happened in California before. This is nature's revenge. We cannot sit still because we have no time left.

This film really pulled at my heartstrings too. I got chills when Nicole (the nurse who was rescued by the fire engine) told her husband she couldn’t run through fire and he responded with “you’re going to have to”. Just thinking about being in that scenario scares me. The film discusses the many reasons that the fire was as destructive as it was, a perfect storm of events really. But, in my opinion, all of these events can be traced back to human action. The PG&E power line failure is an obvious example, but the other examples such as low rainfall and increased temperatures may seem like simply environmental factors out of our control. But when you take a step back, these factors were caused by humans. We have played the largest role in creating the climate crisis, and the destructive natural disasters we are facing aren’t really natural at all.

The video about the camp fire delved into the disastrous consequences which indifference can lead to. The PG&E fire was wholly preventative, assuming proper investment and long-term planning by the company. This incredible inaction and somewhat stupendous decision-making forces consumers to question what they are supporting. Considering that thee lapses in PG&E’s decision-making were only found after a disaster, are there other, similar catastrophes waiting to happen elsewhere, that just have not come to light yet?

The film “Fire in Paradise” was incredibly sad and heartbreaking to see and hear the desperation on the people struggling to deal and run from the fire. Before seeing this film I did not know how extensive the damage was or how incredibly fast the fire moved. And while knowing that these types of wildfires are getting increasingly stronger and common because of climate change, I can’t help but feel that this specific case and damage could have been preventable if pg&e would have just replaced the old parts like they are supposed to. And this fire was incredibly devastating but hopefully it acts as an eye opener to the consequences or effects of climate change but also to the priorities of big gas corporations such as this one because it definitely doesn't appear to be the public’s safety.
  <br><br>
Something I found really interesting from this film was that many of the Paradise residents kept saying that they were not aware of how bad the fire was or that officials were not telling them what they had to do or notify them of the severity of the situation. However, I think in situations such as these officials may not know everything that is going on with the dilemma, as was shown in the film, and I agree with the statement that was said in the film that every person should have an evacuation plan set up for themselves in cases where things are very unexpected such as this one.

I completely agree with the sentiment that this is truly heartbreaking and devastating, not only because of the victims that had to suffer through this scorching fire but because this fire is not the last of them. In fact, climate experts determine that in the decades to come, fires like these will only expand and cause more harm to a larger population. But, I think a great point you made was that you talked about how officials did not know the severity, nor the result of the fire when it first ignited. And to that, I say that you are completely right. I don’t think that when a firefighter stomps through a forest, he expects his equipment to be insufficient in taking fire out. However, I do believe that even if the fire was not potentially dangerous when it began, there still needs to be some informant that relays a message to the surrounding public. Yes, people need to have an evacuation plan, but with limited transportation mediums, and a lack of information to organize a thorough plan, many civilians will escape in a panic. Looking at the city from the documentary, especially at a bird’s eye view, it is clear that Paradise is a suburban town that lies in the center of greenery. So, when people say that they need an escape plan, I am left perplexed because I have no alternative methods of escape besides automobile if all of the greenery surrounding me is on fire, and therefore, prohibits me from having an alternate escape route that does not clog Paradise’s narrow streets. I also believe that there needs to be better transparency within the framework of warning systems because the lack of mobility of Paradise is correlated to the efficiency and timing in which they received alerts if they even did at all.

I completely agree with you. I haven't experienced a wildfire before and wasn't exposed to any knowledge regarding forest fire either. This documentary astonished me with its visual imagery on the intensity and severity of the fire. As far as I'm concerned, PG&E is the root cause of this tragic as they have been informed of violating the restrictions several times but till didn't take action. Its problematic nature, combined with the drought condition, launched the catastrophic fire.  I also support your viewpoint illustrating that officials may not know everything that's going on with the dilemma. There is insufficient communication and asymmetrical information. As the smoke spread rapidly with the wind, planes can't come to help, evacuation via highway is also troublesome. It's reasonable for the officials to be short-sighted. Just as the film has stated, the more you evacuate, the more vehicle there will be, and the more difficult it will turn out to evacuate due to serious capacity limitation. 
  <br><br>
From my perspective, lack of preparedness also intensifies the destructive nature of the fire. There had been only one trial run in 2008 and the chance for rehearsal was very limited. Additionally, not every resident has signed up for Code Red in which they can't get notified. Nobody can envision what happens later even though it begins with a manageable-looking fire. Overall, I was deeply upset when the witnesses were telling their stories. To prevent this incident from re-occuring, we'd better take action to save the climate crisis which in return save our own living environment.

<br><hr>
I agree that the film "Fire in paradise" hit me with a shocking and heartbreaking realization. I've been evacuated twice from fires in my home town and the sense of urgency doesn't tend to hit people ever. Even when the fire was visible from my front window and was not more than a mile away, no body was moving quickly. People blame those that died and saying how foolish and dumb they were for not moving quickly enough. However being faced with a situation that is not familiar and the danger that has been so abstract for so many years, being faced with the real danger is not always so recognizable. Without an evacuation order many people believe that nothing bad would happen because we live in such an advanced society. However people over estimate the our resources and vastly underestimate mother nature. I personally felt emotion when the nurse was speaking to her husband and saying good byes. It was so shocking that within 4 hours you could catch your self surrounded by flames. Also because it happened so early morning people that slept in late foudn them selves surround in flames and burned to death. When the Sheriff explained that he had to speak to a woman who had her family with her and lose connection it terrified me to realize he had no time to think about what happened and just moved on to the next victim of the cave fire. The effects of climate change are huge and are beginning to have its effects on the average person. Tens of thousands of people lost their homes and within 4 hours an entire town had disappeared into ash.

<br><hr>

I agree with the feeling that I can't help with anything. The consequences of fire are devastated. The air condition is horrible at the place where wildfire happened. In southern California, I can personally feel the bad air condition. In the last quarter, I got several alert in santa Barbara about the fire and evacuation. The fire is so close to me near my school. The school canceled the class because of the air condition. I can hear the helicopters flying at night. I am so nervous about the consequences. Sometimes in the news of the other fires, I can see the houses are burned down, the animals were running, even people or firemen died during the fire. These people suffered from the consequences of the climate crisis. The climate change happened around the whole world. I saw the news of Australia, the size of the wildfire is enormous as the professor said in the video. It is four times as the combination of the fifteen biggest fire in California. In other news, I saw a picture with Kola without fur near the fire, which makes me feel very sad. I think everyone should be aware with the climate crisis, and do something to prevent the bad consequences.

In the film, “Fire in Paradise”, there was perfect representation on how climate change impacts people when they least expect it. My previous knowledge of the Camp Fire changed tremendously. When I first heard about this fire back in 2018 I knew it was troublesome and serious for the environment, yet I had no idea how badly this fire changed people’s lives. Throughout the film I was able to understand how climate change is occurring as we speak, however what are we really doing in order to fight it? When I heard that the Camp Fire was spreading at 80 football fields a minute, I was in disbelief that a fire could spread at such rate. It really puts things into perspective on how any fire today can be double dangerous and stronger than a fire from 10 years ago. We are not ready even if we want to argue that our cities/states/countries have a plan. Furthermore, I agree with a statement made in this film, “...people have to be responsible for their own safety. The best person to craft an evacuation plan for you is you”. At this point in time, we can never be too sure about our climate. It is vital to have a plan on what to do incase if you’re ever faced with a sudden hurricane or fire instead of waiting for authorities or the news to let people know what is going on. Our safety should be first, thus if you know you life is in danger don't wait, move. These events leave people traumatized. For example, last year towards the end of fall quarter, there was a fire very close by to UCSB and the only thing that I could think about was the possibility of the fire turning into a massive one as the Thomas Fire. You read and hear about all these natural disasters happening around the world or even in your state, but you never really consider that it might happen exactly where you live, until it does. Also after watching Ken’s video on “Fire in Paradise” and hearing how Australia's current fire is 4x bigger than the biggest 15 fires of  CA COMBINED, was heartbreaking. Not only are families being left behind with no homes, but species are also being killed and reduced everyday by this fire. Extreme heat, strong winds, and droughts are a perfect mix for a disaster with climate change being the secret ingredient. The future generation will look back on this fire and ask us, “If you saw how your actions were impacting the planet - stronger fires, hurricanes, droughts, etc. - why didn’t you do anything to stop it?”

This film surprised me in many of the same ways. Witnessing the spread and later destruction of the fire through the videos shown was absolutely terrifying. This fire was an example of how extreme the effects of climate change can be and how they have the potential to beat evacuation plans. Paradise, a town with ten thousand more people than in Goleta, was obliterated in just a few hours. With the delayed evacuation notice, people didn't have enough time to escape, and if they tried, they were surrounded by fire, traffic, and almost unbreathable air. The head of the Paradise Fire Department said that he believed that the protocols went smoothly; however, I think he is entirely wrong. Without aircraft, there was no way to determine the speed of the fire, and in this case it is a much better idea to play it safe and send an alert to the public. Once an alert was sent, less than half of the population received it, creating miscommunications for the other 50-60%. Although these type of emergencies can't be predicted, people in authority need to think realistically now that we have a dryer, warmer climate. An alert system is a priority for people, and without it, many did not take the fire seriously and lost their lives. 
  <br><br>
In the end, everyone did their job and went above and beyond to save as many people as possible. However, in this case, I think playing it safe and alerting people earlier would have at least saved more lives, since the fire was unstoppable.

The movie “The Fire in Paradise” presents us an impressive contrast between the place with beautiful trees, hummingbirds, and butterflies and the result that the so-called paradise is ruined by the fire. As mentioned in the movie, there is blowing storm and the weather is critically dry before the fire. The summer is much drier, hotter, and humidity. The movie clearly shows us the process of how the fire is spread as the time goes by and how people react and feel about it under the emergency. Through this documentary movie, the audience get a sense of how the climate change—global warming—can cause serious environmental crisis and affect people’s life to a great extent.
  <br><br>

 Also mentioned in the movie, human caused climate change has doubled wildfire. It also reminds people about the potential actions which would harm the environment that in return, jeopardize their own life.

I think this film was very effective at communicating its subject as the video gave me chills and was very frightening and sad. Hearing people’s stories of being trapped in the fires, then hearing the fear in their voices when they were in the moment. The worst part about this video was the bad communication of government officials to the citizens which caused people to not believe they needed to evacuate resulting in the loss of life. I think the film’s audience was aimed at telling the true story of the citizens of Concow. 
  <br><br>

The general reaction to the film was that I feel so bad. I was in Canada in 2018 when the bad fires hit and resulted in a similar issue as people were surrounded and losing their homes and lives. I do not know if I believe that PGE deserves to be faced with charges but I feel like they need to make mends and remove all of the towers that are out of date. I think it is crazy how the fire was spreading eighty football fields per minute and that the whole town of Paradise was burnt in a total of only four hours. I would recommend this video to a friend but it is very sad and depressing.

The film describes the whole event very well, describing the different psychological states of people before and after the fire in detail. In less than an hour's documentary, we can see the tragic fire at that time. It also tells us the severity of the fire. The fire is also the deadliest in years in the United States. Because of global warming, some areas are in a long-term dry environment. It leads to the frequent occurrence of fire, and the probability of fire will continue to rise with the increasing global heat in the future. Before watching this documentary, I knew the horror of the fire, but what I didn't expect was that the fire could happen so quickly that so many people couldn't evacuate. It can also be seen that many people don't pay attention to the fire, because PG & E company's dereliction of duty leads to such a serious event. Paradise did not give a warning in time after the fire. These two neglect led directly to the disaster. But it has happened. We can't change the past, but we can learn from it and change the future. Let such a thing not happen again.

The film Fire in Paradise talks about the Camp Fire, which took place on November 8, 2018, until it was put out by the first winter rain in 2018, and its horrible consequences. This fire became the most devastating natural disaster in California history, even surpassing the Thomas fire. After watching this documentary, I deeply feel the powerlessness of human beings in front of nature. In the face of this devastating natural disaster, people had no choice but to run and pray. When three ladies were trapped in the house by fire, I could feel their despair through their voice on the phone. When the phone went dead at last, the final hope disappeared.
   <br><br>

In my perspective, the sense of crisis is far less intense when talking about sea-level rise and floods than it is now when talking about mountain fires. On the eve of Thanksgiving last year, I suddenly received a wildfire alert from the school. At first, I didn't pay much attention to it until the night of the day. The alarm came again and again, and I gradually felt the severity of the problem. At about 8 pm, through the windows of the Santa Catalina Hall, I could see the firelight from the mountains not far away, accompanied by heavy smoke. People kept posting pictures of the fire and sending messages to each other. The power supply was also affected, and the flashes from time to time made me a little nervous. Fortunately, the fire went out the next day. But the air quality was quite poor, and there was still smoke in the air. Eventually, the school announced a full suspension and entered the Thanksgiving holiday early. If the fire was not put out in time but was getting bigger, I do not know what terrible things might happen.
   <br><br>

Although the management has certain responsibilities, I don’t think it is proper to show excessive blame on the government. Some people blamed most of the responsibility on the local government afterward, thinking that a better evacuation plan should be formulated, the evacuation route should be widened earlier, various facilities should be checked earlier, etc. However, just as mentioned in the film, there are lots of limitations. For example, a lot of funds will be needed to widen the roads. This is an unfortunate fact: in most cases, people cannot improve the corresponding countermeasures until the problem occurs. For example, only when a new type of virus appears and causes damage can various anti-virus software develops to stop the virus. I think this is one of many places where we need to improve.

I completely agree with you. The way that Fire in Paradise documented the victims of the fire makes me feel sympathetic and it stresses the level of urgency to take action on climate change right now. 
   <br><br>
The mountains fire last year was very scary and shocking to me. Growing up in Beijing, I had never witnessed any kind of natural disaster , and the only kind of disaster that I had experienced was coming from all the factories and construction sites which are man-made. The fire showed me what humans do can affect the environment and it made me see the issue of climate change more vividly. I have experience both what humans do to the environment and what nature does in response to our behavior.
   <br><br>
Instead of pushing responsibilities to one another, I believe we should all be on the same page when it comes to conserving our environment.

Completely heartbreaking, devastating, terrifying, so many mixed emotions this film brought to me and im sure to any other moral human. I'm not so sure if there is an exact word to perfectly describe how I felt while watching the film “Fire in Paradise.” This film sure did a great job with capturing the audience's attention in a very emotional way. The film included real footage that had been captured during the time of the fire to show us, the viewers, what exactly was occuring at the time. By doing this, it makes you feel pain and sympathy for those who are victims of the fire, those whose family members died because of the fire, those who fought against the fires and fought to save the lives of other people. 
    <br><br>
One thing that was common throughout the film was the lack of seriousness people had towards the start of the fire. They showed a clip of an interview with a police officer and the officer stated “you know, I think like a lot of people, didn't really take it too serious - we get a lot of fires up there.” This made me very frustrated because what doesn't seem like a big deal to some people at a certain time will eventually become a big deal. It is sad to think that we have come to the point in which fires are very common that someone says “oh it's just another fire, nothing new, nothing serious,” when in fact we should treat every disaster as something serious no matter the size because we never know what turn it would take. There were many other similar quotes from the film along the lines of “I don't think she realized how bad it was” or “I wasn't thinking it was that serious at first.” We don't realize there is a problem until you are finally faced with the consequences. This can be seen with the company PG&E; they didn't change their transmission towers although they were previously warned that they were old and needed to be changed. The company was not going to change their towers until they saw a problem with it, and indeed they were faced with a number of problems because of it. We must stop ignoring the signs and finally face them before it's too late.

Hi,     <br><br>

I also agree with your statements regarding the lack of seriousness and PG&E's actions towards their transmission towers. It deeply angered me when people weren't taking the fire serious because it could have saved some peoples' lives. This is one of the consequences when some lack or disagree with the fact that climate change isn't real. For example, the 911 dispatcher mentioned that the fire wasn't a threat and how they failed to alert the entire town of Paradise to evacuate. They only alerted those who signed up which I think was stupid and irresponsible but like the one deputy in the film said: "ultimately, you are responsible for getting out, your own evacuation, for your own life." It's sad but it's true. They failed to have adequate evacuation plans thus, causing a total traffic jam. And those who stayed in their homes during the fire made me feel furious yet sad and confused at the same time. The part where the woman who stayed in her home whilst her daughter left created such a powerful scene because it portrays how people fail to see their surroundings falling apart but don't even notice it. Likewise, the same type of situation happened for PG&E. They were warned about their transmission lines and the life expectancy of it but they failed to notice it and did nothing. The fire could have been prevented if they had just changed it but there's always that "I'll do it later." "A couple more days/weeks won't hurt." It's a terrible mentality and can be fatal for the future. I do agree when you say "We must stop ignoring the signs and finally face them before it's too late" because it was too late for Paradise and it may be too late for the rest of the world if we do nothing.

I completely agree. I remember hearing all about the Camp fire when it happened because I was living in Los Angeles and people talked about it a lot, not to mention it was everywhere in the media- however it wasn’t until I watched this film that I understood how horrific this event was. The film captures the destruction and devastation perfectly. Originally, I was really confused about the whole evacuation because I saw so many videos of people in their cars surrounded by this fire, but this documentary was really helpful in breaking down what actually happened. I really think that the emergency relief teams did everything they could, and that’s precisely what makes this fire so scary.. Because they couldn’t control, it was so powerful. It’s so unsettling that emergency relief did everything they could and still despite all efforts the fire burned 153,000 acres and killed 85 people. Its deeply frustrating that Pacific Gas and Electric hasn’t been held accountable, and that people do not seem to see this fire as the massive warning it is. As climate change continues fires like this will happen more often and only become larger and more destructive- especially in California. It only took a matter of hours for the whole town of Paradise to be burnt to the ground, displacing thousands of lives- and living in california people must begin to realize that if things do not change course this could be the likely impact on anyone’s community or town. I feel deeply sad for those impacted by this fire, and I feel deeply sad for this planet.
   <br><br>

Wildfires seem to be happening far more often than ever before, even reflecting back on this year a number of large monstrous fires have happened. Australia is burning as I type this.. and the amazon continues to be abused. Companies and industries responsible for these incidences must be held accountable for their crimes. It is pure negligence on their part and the whole world is paying the consequences.

This film,in short, was heartbreaking. Usually when watching the films, there is a disconnect because I haven’t experienced or noticed many of the changes to the environment personally. However, “Fire in Paradise” resonated with me because during the same time my own home town was on fire in a much smaller wildfire labeled the “Holy Fire” that burned over 23,000 acres in the Riverside/Orange County area. I remember the day the fire started, I could see the smoke arising over the mountains which at the time seemed so far away, until suddenly in the coming days it became so close that we had to evacuate to remain safe from the approaching fire. While watching this film I was reminded of the anxiety I had felt while having to pack up my childhood home and leave behind items of my life that I never thought I’d be missing. Thankfully in my case, the fire ended up being contained and there was not much damage was done to any residential areas, and furthermore no one was fatally injured. Due to this experience, I feel as though I watched this film with a different perspective, considering how real and intense it presented the climate crisis to be. As Ken mentioned in the video, there is a tendency to view the consequences of climate change as an issue for the future and not a current problem while evidently that is not the case. Sadly, devastating disasters such as the Paradise Fire are required to actually open people’s eyes to the changing environment and encourage them to fight for a sustainable future. 
    <br><br>

Another aspect of the documentary that is of relevance, is it’s relation to the current wildfire spreading across Australia. To give perspective, the fire that attacked the mountains of my hometown burned 23,000 acres, the Paradise fire burned 153,000 acres and the Australian wildfire burned over 20 million acres. If this isn’t evidence enough of the danger presented by climate change, then I don’t know what is. If no change occurs, then fires will keep increasingly getting worse and we will continue to see our land burn until there is nothing left. At this point there is only one question remaining that every climate skeptic needs to answer… Is the price of being proven wrong worth the lives of millions of innocent people? Because at this rate, those who are opposing climate change efforts, those who are standing by the USA’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord, and those who are supporting the naivety of politicians claiming the climate change is a “hoax”are those who will be held responsible for the demise of planet Earth.

I'd like to touch on the last component of your response - "is the price of being proven wrong worth the lives of millions of innocent people?" Literally, the answer to that question is: yes. The unfortunate reality is that climate denial and skepticism is an extremely effective tool used by massive fossil-fuel interests to stall climate action and secure their assets. The amount of profit these companies would lose if we were to take serious action against fossil-fuels is enormous. Speaking purely in terms of monetary value, the losses these companies would incur would likely be greater than the total life earnings of the millions, tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of the poorest people on the planet combined. Frankly speaking, for the fossil-fuel industry and associated interests, the price of being proven wrong is LITERALLY worth the lives of millions of people. This is a fundamental flaw in our economic model, which inherently produces this sort of inequality and injustice. Therefore, any truly effective climate change strategies must consider the issue of climate justice.

The fact that sign ups for the Code Red alert system were the only system used in Paradise at the time is confusing to me because if safety was such a necessity, all people would have been alerted through phone or some other sort of way. However, to contradict that, cell phone towers were not working because of the fire in the first place, so what happens then? What happens to those who aren’t signed up? Do they just wait it out until it’s too late? Is it their fault for not evacuating? Is there no solution at this point?
    <br><br>

Seeing how Christina’s mother refused to evacuate even with visual proof of the fire practically engulfing all of Paradise relates to the fact that many older generations are firm in their beliefs and will not take into consideration anything that contradicts them. Like Ken spoke about in Monday’s lecture, the people who have the most power to take a stand against climate change are people his age and older, and those individuals are the ones who refuse to do anything substantial about it, or fail to take the climate crisis into consideration in general. In regards to the people of Paradise in general, there seemed to be a “false sense of security” as stated by a 911 operator in the film. In reality, there wasn’t enough/correct transportation for the entire population to evacuate, especially those attempting to evacuate the hospital, let alone the fact that the roads were too small for such a large amount of people to leave the town.

The questions you posed about the evacuation systems in place for the town of Paradise, CA were exactly the same questions that ran through my mind while I watched this film. It is very easy to blame the first responders and dispatchers in Paradise, and say that their systems were completely inadequate to deal with a fire of this magnitude. However, as the climate crisis rages on, and weather events become more disastrous, how can cities ever be fully prepared for the scale of what may come their way? According to the fire chief in Paradise, they had an evacuation plan set in place that every first responder carried in their emergency vehicle, but when a real disaster struck, that plan became almost useless. This film made me realize that as climate change becomes more violent and unpredictable, cities and individuals need to have a fully equipped evacuation plan. For example, in Paradise when 50,000 residents were trying to escape all at once, the roads were blocked and cars came to a full stop. A blockage like this could have been avoided if Paradise had previously been granted the budget request they made to build more roads in the event of a fire. 
    <br><br>


This film also brought my attention to the need for climate justice. I found the negligence of PG&E to be appalling, it is difficult for me to understand how they could continue to use old equipment that could lead to a crisis. According to NPR, PG&E agreed to pay an $11 billion settlement for damages inflicted by the wildfires. Although I am glad PG&E did not escape unscathed, I am still angry for the long-lasting damages on the landscape that will take years to regrow, the community that must rebuild, and the individuals who were displaced and injured due to their negligence.

The film “Fire in Paradise,” is about the Camp Fire that took place from November 8 until November 25, last year in 2018. It was the most destructive natural disaster worldwide in 2018 and the most destructive wildfire in California history. Human-caused climate change has doubled the amount of wildfires since 1984 and summers have warmed by 2.5 degrees in the last 50 years in Northern California. On top of this, prolonged drought is much more common and it doesn’t rain until late in December. This is very bad news for Californians who will have to deal with increasingly deadly and frequent fires as a result of climate change.
    <br><br>

What made the Camp Fire so deadly was the fact that it spread so fast. Usually in a fire, smoke travels up where there is cooler air, so the air puts out a lot of the embers. In this case however, winds blew the embers, which made fireballs shoot all over Paradise. This fire spread so fast that the citizens did not have the time nor the means to evacuate. The road that was the evacuation route could not contain the amount of people trying to escape. One of the interviewees stated that the town of Paradise had a more thought out plan for fire and evacuation. This got me thinking about what would happen if a fire of this magnitude happened in Irvine, where I’m from. The city is incredibly dense in population and it could be really dangerous evacuating all of the people. California, in general, needs to act fast and come up with better plans because wildfires are not going away any time soon.
    <br><br>

I think that this film did a great job of using real footage to make the viewer feel almost like they were there experiencing the pain and struggle that the city had to go through. It almost felt like I was watching a fictional movie because the footage all came together and told the story so well. I found the interviews very interesting, especially Nichole Jolly’s story. When she was trying to escape the fire, I felt like I was watching a thriller and that I had to not blink so that I wouldn’t miss anything. The sad reality is that this wasn’t a fictional movie and the interviewees were not actors. They were real people. While this fire was horrible, it was not unprecedented. This will happen again and like I said before, if we don’t mitigate global warming, people will continue to lose their homes, and maybe even their lives.

This film does an incredible job of explaining to the audience how the Camp Fire started and the damage it did in just a few hours. Fires are not at all unusual in California, so people tend to not be as worried about them as they should be. This fire started small and could have been handled like any other small brush fire, but spread quickly in such a short amount of time due to the strong winds and the amount of dry brush in the area. It started as something that probably wouldn't have been told on the news and ended up being the worst fire that California has ever had. The film effectively retold the story of the spread of the Camp Fire, showing that no one was that worried about it when it first ignited. As the film progressed, so did the panic and desperation of the people that were caught in the middle of the fire.
    <br><br>

I knew of the debate of holding PG&E accountable for the fire, but did not understand the details of why the company was being accused. At first I thought they were just looking for someone to blame, but this film cleared that up for me. PG&E neglected their job of maintaining the equipment used to provide people with energy and, due to this neglect, an entire town was lost. The company has had so many run ins with legal issues because of their ignorance when regarding their own safety protocols. I like how one of the journalists being interviewed stated something along the lines of, “If PG&E were a single person, they would be in prison.” I think this statement is true. The company seems to get away with any problems caused by them because they are powerful. This goes for a lot of other companies as well, such as oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil. 
    <br><br>

The film does not touch on climate change as much as I thought it would since it focused so heavily on the stories of people who were involved in the fire. The only part that talked about the climate that I noticed was when one of the men explained how the dry season is longer and more severe. It was briefly mentioned but it explains one of the main reasons why the fire spread so quickly. It was explained that Paradise got little to no rain for eight months before the fire. If temperatures are rising and wet seasons are getting shorter, the Camp Fire will no longer be the most catastrophic fire in California within the next few years. What occurred in Paradise has shown us that we are drastically unprepared for how bad these fires will continue to get if we don’t stop global temperature rise.

I was shocked after watching this film. It’s terrible and unbelievable people just stuck in the fire when the wildfire came and they had no way to get out. This fire accident was vividly recorded in this film. When the wildfire started beginning, people’s psychology changed from don’t care and absent-minded, to serious face the fire  and hope to rely on human resources to solve it, to powerless, they have to face the harsh challenges of nature and people have no choice to get out but to accept, to pray for God's blessing, and finally have to admit the smallness and fragility of human beings. They have to try every means to escape from their home in order to survive. From this incident, we can clearly see that many people even the fire department are not enough to predict the harm of the fire, they are perfunctory and do things carelessly and finally they face the facts. Therefore, for human beings, any natural disaster should not be underestimated and must be seriously faced and dealt with. But in this accident, the fire department did not have a clear evacuation plan and did not notice people timely and officially. That’s may can be one of the reason that so many people died in the accident and many of them even can not leave their apartment. So this incident have to be memorized and in case it happens again.

This film offers a nightmarish point of view of California wild fires. Seeing footage taken by primary sources that shows how bad the damage was is terrifying. The entire city of Paradise looked like what I envision hell to be-just massive flames in every direction. It's devastating to see how many people lost their lives and home. I have massive respect for fire fighters after watching this video and a lot more disrespect towards PG&E. They ignored the signs that their equipment is out of date and refused to take the utmost precaution. As a result-the massive fire.
    <br><br>


What also struck me was how unprepared the city was. I don't blame them however, because no one would have anticipated a fire this damaging. This should be taken as a clear sign of climate change by those who do not believe in it. This film does a great job in providing first hand footage. Hearing conversations of people on the phone with the police not knowing what to do and seeing people in the middle of a cloud of smoke and fire elicits great concern on the subject. Local governments who are in fire prone zones need to do more in preparation for evacuation plans and people need to learn more about fire danger in their community.

You’re right, this film truly showed what one would envision when they think of hell with flames engulfing everywhere in sight and closing in rapidly.  With the live first hand footage and accounts of the event, it really allows the audience to become immersed in what it felt like to live through it.  It is truly shocking to see what exactly happened and how dangerous it was to be there.  This was 4 hours of pure terror for all those involved in the evacuation.  With that, it really showed how unprepared the city of Paradise was for the CampFire.  The evacuation plans in place simply didn’t and don’t cut it when it comes to the response to fires that have become worse and worse due to the climate crisis.  As a result, they must become more thorough in their ability to efficiently and quickly respond to fires such as the CampFire.  These longer fire seasons with increased temperatures, high winds, and very dry conditions create the perfect stage for fires to cause mass destruction.  In light of this we must be cautious and aware.  Especially companies like PG&E must be held accountable for their knowledgeable shortcomings that cause such things as the various fires in California.  They deliberately do not make changes and are more concerned with how they do financial wise than all of the damage they cause.
    <br><br>

Education is also a component that should be addressed because there were countless people who stayed back at home because they didn’t think the fire was as bad as it really was.  These deaths could have been prevented and therefore more people should be informed on the natural disasters in their areas and how climate change is affecting these disasters to become even more prevalent and dangerous.

Before watching the documentary, I had assumed that PG&E was being used as a scapegoat for a natural wildfire to deter attention away from the continuous drought influenced by climate change. But, this was a sorely mistaken view as the negligence on the company's part had a hand in multiple deaths from the fire, in addition to, the deaths caused by the mudslides in Montecito. Now the company has paid off 13.5 billion in settlements and has filed for bankruptcy protection. This is climate justice. If companies become more accountable for their actions, then we will start seeing change at the national level. 
    <br><br>

The rate of natural disasters is exponentially increasing, as well as, the destructive capabilities of them. Now more than ever, we as citizens need to take on the role of fighting for this change. If we don't start fighting for what we believe in, then we may end up being deserted and left to fend for ourselves. Australia right now is in a state of disarray due to the overwhelming fire. There are countless accusations of the country not being well adept at handling the fires. This is a result of the lack of social activism forcing internal change. This is not to bash the citizens of Australia, but to show the impact of living in an increasingly threatening environment with only a first-aid kit.

I totally agree with your opinion. I think even though the fire on Paradise started because of the failed, aged equipment of PG&E, human’s impacts on the Earth’s climate also plays a big role in this terrible disaster. Just like the video mentioned, the temperature in California has increased by an average of two to five degrees in the last fifty years, and because of the human-caused climate change, the times in which wildfire appeared has doubled since 1984. Without the other factors such as the rising temperature and drought in California, there ought to be only a controllable fire in Paradise which can soon be put out quickly by firefighters, instead of a horrific catastrophe like this.
      <br><br>
    However, just like the professor said in the lecture, there are still some people right now think that the consequence of global warming is only sea-level rising, and it can be addressed by the authorities appropriately. However, with the several severe wildfire burnt in California, they need to realize the fact that the negative results of the climate crisis are everywhere in our world, and plenty of them, such as greenhouse effect and wildfire, have already appeared with a fast speed and harmed people as well as their facilities. 
      <br><br>
    By demonstrating the consequences of the fire disaster which took place in Paradise, “Fire on Paradise” effectively calls for people’s attention as well as actions to stop the climate crisis right now, before more terrible catastrophes come.


<br><Hr>

I 100% agree with you that I didn’t really understand why PG&E’s name was being thrown around so often when discussing wildfires. After watching the film and learning that they had the chance to turn off the power and neglected to do so, scares me. It scares me mainly because it makes it seem like they have all the power and they aren’t doing enough with that power. Now that many fingers have been pointed at them and they have had to pay off many settlements, they need to replace their machinery. In the film it was stated that the average age of their poles is around 60 years old when they are not meant to be sustained that long. Simple fixes such as replacing old lines could have saved millions of acres of land that was burnt all throughout California. 
       <br><br>
  Previous to watching this film I wasn’t particularly educated about the Paradise fire or other wildfires such as the Thomas fire. But I feel responsible for spreading the word about how the real issue is climate change. The increasing rate of wildfires is due to a longer summer and much longer dry spells throughout the winter. We do need to take action right away in order to prevent such damaging disasters. I personally like how you related the Paradise fire to what is currently happening in Australia because it’s true we do need more social activism. It can’t be only a few people we need everyone involved in this fight if we want to end climate change as a whole and save the earth before it’s too late.

<br><Hr>

Wow. You really hit some terrific points in this comment. PG&E's negligence, failure to stay up to code with fire hazards, and failure to turn off the power when the Camp fire started should be a fair warning for all types of different electricity companies. It is time that these big companies realize that there is more to making money continuously when you live on our planet with billions of other people on it. I think the Camp fire is a 'perfect' catastrophe to use in environmental activism when being able to mention the 70 people that burned and the tens of thousands that lost their homes. It is not a matter of fact that the town of paradise just wasn't "ready," there was no way they could have expected a fire that large and there were MANY ways in which the catalyst of the fire could have prevented it.

Although very tough to watch, this film did exactly what it was meant to do: give a face to the effects of the climate crisis in California. While this documentary could move me to tears on its own, it was even more powerful in relaying its message for me, as I am from NorCal and experienced the aftermath of the fire first hand in the form of smoke, ash, and debri. However, despite the fact that I was so (relatively) close to the place of so much heartbreak and destruction, I was unaware of the impacts of such a blaze on the community, during and after the fire. This film clearly conveyed how the negligence and ignorance of people and, more specifically, the heads of large corporations can lead to such devastating consequences. This further reiterates the large part humans have to play in the worsening of the climate situation. It is very upsetting to me that, in the case of the Camp Fire, there were plans and regulations put into place to protect and control the town of Paradise from a fiery destruction, but not even all of this well-thought-out preparation could save it. This goes to show that taking steps to cope with the increase in fire (or climate in general) magnitude is not an ample solution; the climate crisis must be fixed at the root of the issue. 
       <br><br>

One final note I will make is that, although the point of the film was not necessarily to applaud the work of humans, it was truly astonishing to witness such bravery and courage by all those who fought for their own lives and the lives of others. The extent to which these people had gone to rescue others in need gives me hope that these same efforts can be directed towards the climate crisis in its entirety, as now we are all in need of saving.

I completely agree that the film was extremely effective in humanizing this issue. Often times it is difficult for people to sympathize with the issue when they have not yet felt the effects of climate change, however this film is able to capture the unabated human reaction to how this fire, like countless others, have effected millions. Moreover, I also strongly agree that this film is successful in showing how a company’s negligence can have disastrous consequences. While PG&E is just one example of a company that has done this, the fossil fuel industry is full of big money companies who refuse to take environmental responsibility for the ramifications of their actions. The parallels between the tobacco industry and the fossil fuel industry are undeniable, but have we not already learned from the tobacco industry the consequences of negligence? 

       <br><br>

Just as you said, I also find it frustrating that the evacuation plans and emergency protocols had been set in place but were too poorly planned to properly address the situation. While it is easy to hold PG&E liable for the extent of the damage, there was also the issue of miscommunication. Despite efforts to prepare, the lack of preparedness is a prime example of just how unequipped we are for a disaster of this magnitude. Not only this but the frequency of these disasters at this magnitude will only become more frequent as the climate continues to warm. 

       <br><br>

The Camp Fire not only served to show our lack of preparedness, but also revealed how our infrastructure cannot withstand the consequences of climate change. While the cost of the damage created by disasters of this scale already amount to staggering numbers, adapting our infrastructure to withstand the effects of climate change will only add to these costs. Overall, this documentary was successful in humanizing this issue and showing how the consequences of global warming have already begun to take effect.

Fire in Paradise evoked a great emotional response. I felt astonished, then incredibly sad. The stories of the people: Jordan, Christina, Nichole, and many others, who were in the midst of the fire felt incredibly raw. The feeling of astonishment arose as the dispatcher told callers the fire did not pose a threat. There was a complete lack of awareness and communication about the fire’s movement between the fire department and the dispatchers in Paradise. I wondered why the dispatcher didn’t take the warning of witnesses who saw the fire more seriously, evacuating them earlier. However, I want to make it clear that I am not assigning blame to any one person. 
        <br><br>

I was also astonished by the evacuation plan, where people were evacuated by zones. In the face of emergencies, there should be a plan to evacuate whole towns because each life matters. The implementation of zones and lack of a clear evacuation plan put more people in harms way. As one man mentioned in the film, additional roads for evacuation aren’t worth the investment if an emergency may occur only a handful of times. So, what would be a solution to ensuring the safety of people evacuating? Their current plan did not work. I did some additional research to figure out the town’s updated plans. Road pathways are currently being investigated, but as the population is only 4,000, there doesn’t seem to be an urgent desire to build more roads/change current plan in case of future disasters (“Paradise, California is Struggles to Rebuild Safer after Deadly Camp Fire”). 
        <br><br>

Hearing the stories of people who were affected made me incredibly sad, I even shed a couple tears. Losing their homes, their sense of security, and their loved ones must have been devastating. Yet, I find myself watching the film, feeling sad, and moving on to other activities I need to do. Though I care about those who were affected, feeling sad doesn’t prompt action. As an individual, my actions to change the condition of the planet carry little weight. Furthermore, I have little optimism in a large group of people forming to collectively change the condition of the planet. As experienced in lecture, a lot of people recognize that climate change is occurring, but the people that recognize the problem are also doing little to solve it, including me. The focus of slowing down climate change needs to be on tangible solutions.

Great comment. Usually what happens in order to allocate funding for disaster prevention/mediation is a risk assessment, and that determines how much money and in what way will be allocated. With this kind of ultra destructive and no margin for error natural disasters, no matter what everyone loses.
        <br><br>

The thing that maybe want to suggest is your pessimism in the last paragraph. I think that exactly these kinds of events can actually help in the battle of the climate crisis. For starters it becomes an ominous and emotional beacon for people to mobilise against CO2-emitting interests. Politicians and corporations can increasingly no longer hide behind excuses and distorting the truth. Secondly, just as with PG&E, these disasters are starting to hit large corporations hard. At some point soon their waning public image combined with climate uncertainty/natural disaster may combine to flip the economics of what they're doing, making it more profitable to actually do the right thing, be sustainable. For example, PG&E might deem it more appropriate to move to decentralised solar power rather than incur the costs associated with centralised fossil derived electricity.

I remember reading about the Camp Fire when it first occurred, but it was only after watching a Fire in Paradise that I began to understand the catastrophic consequences of the fire. It is one thing to read about the fire, however, it is another thing to watch the quick progression of the fire with my own eyes and to see individuals speak about their experiences during the fire. I thought the documentary did a great job of including videos and visuals to make the viewer feel as if they were in the middle of the chaos. I found it jarring to see the huge red and grey clouds of smoke, thousands of embers in contrast to the black sky, the road surrounded by flames and burning cars, and the aftermath of the fire. I was moved by the personal stories that people shared. Such as the nurse who had no other option but to run through the fire and thought she was about to die.

        <br><br>

I thought it was insane how a small vegetation fire turned into a wildfire that burned the entire town of Paradise in four hours. A wildfire that burned a total of 153,000 acres. A wildfire that destroyed the homes of 30,000 people and took the lives of 85 people. A wildfire that was the deadliest in California history. What is most concerning is that this fire is not an anomaly, but a part of a larger trend. Ten out of the twenty most destructive wildfires in California have occurred in the past four years and will continue as the climate crisis is projected to increase the severity and frequency of wildfires. 

        <br><br>

I appreciated how the film discussed PG&E and the company’s role in the fire. I was unaware that PG&E decided not to turn off the power to the power lines during the high winds, which would have prevented the fire. I immediately wondered if the company did not turn off the power because they would lose profits. I was surprised to learn that PG&E’s equipment has been linked to many other fires in California. The documentary was quick to place the blame of the Camp Fire on PG&E, however, I believe that the real blame is on us. Specifically, on our materialist culture, which is fueled by fossil fuels.

I did the same, I saw on twitter only short clips about this devastating fire, but this documentary truly put into perspective just how destructive it actually was. The part that really hit home for me was when the 25 year old woman had to leave her obstinate mother behind. When there was a fire threatening my neighbor hood (thankfully no humans/buildings were harmed), my dad refused to leave. This film just showed how real these fires are. 

        <br><br>


The facts in “Fire in Paradise” are truly heartbreaking. Just out of PG&E’s negligence 85 people lost their lives and 30,000 people were now misplaced and without a home. It is insane how quickly that fire moved and makes me think of how Australia is being affected by the same crisis. Although there are still skeptics, how do they explain these massive and record breaking fires only happening in the last decade? Corporations can be a big part to blame because, like you said, they probably did not shut down an old power line due to profit being lost, but it is also the human races responsibility to turn this all around. Going back to Australia once more, I read that theirs was simply due to extremely dry conditions. We need to all open our eyes and be a little more woke on how we can individually help and prevent these from happening, as well as holding corporations responsible for their actions.

<br><hr>
I agree with your feelings of greater understanding and emotion regarding the devastating Camp Fire. I remember hearing about the terrible, uninhabitable conditions of Paradise, but no news was as moving as this documentary. To see so many videos and pictures and hear of many people’s stories made the fire more of a terrifying reality in my mind, more than anything I had seen at the time of the fire. Being from Northern California, I definitely felt some of the impacts of this catastrophe, but the effects of the fire were more of an inconvenience in the Bay Area, not a matter of life or death, as they were in Paradise.
        <br><br>

Additionally, I appreciated that you not only recognized the blame on PG&E, but on humanity as a whole. With our selfish consumptive habits, we’ve created an environment more prone to natural disaster than ever before. While the fire technically started with PG&E, the intensity came from anthropogenic climate change, and we must also take the blame for such a disastrous and heartbreaking event. This past fall, when threats of fires were in Northern California, many of my friends and family back home had their power shut off, as the risks of fire were very high, and PG&E wasn’t willing to take any chances. After receiving the brunt of the blame for the Camp Fire, I think that it is definitely in its best interest to be extremely careful, as the company should aim to be safe rather than sorry (again).
        <br><br>

As a whole, I felt that this documentary was very devastating. I could feel the emotion through the screen, and it was very challenging to watch. I could never imagine the emotional toll of the first responders and officers who felt as if they had let people down, even when they didn’t have the information themselves. The courage of the countless firefighters was admirable, and I have nothing but respect for those who risked their lives in attempts to save others'.


<br><hr>
Prior to this documentary, I was not even aware of this fire; I’ve never lived in a fire-prone region and have never experienced it. In a sense, I am by default detached from these catastrophes, which is a similar reaction many have toward the current Australian bush fires. Perhaps this is why I has such a visceral reaction to the documentary. The damage and intensity were unlike anything I could have imagined. Post-viewing, I began to wonder about the condition of Paradise now, a little over a year after the fire. After some brief internet scanning, I discovered that restoration is slow-moving, painful, and expensive. There is extensive damage throughout the area including uncleared homes and lots, burnt remains of debris, and fire-contaminated pipes that prevent the deliverance of clean water to the town. Most people have not returned to Paradise after the fire.
        <br><br>

As for PG&E, although the company has caused numerous California wildfires, they still provide gas and electricity to about 16 million people. And why shouldn’t they? People need energy to live in California, and they shouldn’t have to choose between having power and raging wildfires. PG&E needs to be held accountable of course, though it becomes much more difficult to hold a multi-billion-dollar corporation responsible and demand change when people still need what they’re selling, regardless of how they get it.
        <br><br>

This is congruent with the much larger humanitarian issue you mentioned; we are attempting to fix the symptoms of the climate crisis without addressing the source of the disease. What does it matter if we can rebuild the town with wider roads to mitigate the traffic in the event of another fire if we aren’t doing anything to prevent the fires in the first place? As humans we seem to be spiraling downwards, not learning from our mistakes, and exacerbating the initial crisis through inaction.

<br><hr>



I found your comment very insightful. I feel that PG&E is currently trapped in a difficult situation. People want electricity and will complain if PG&E shuts off the electricity during times of high fire danger. At the same time, people really do not want to wildfires and will complain if the electricity provided for them by PG&E starts a fire. On a similar note, people living in developed countries want to maintain their materialistic lifestyles and high standard of living. Yet, these very people do not want to experience the impacts of climate change, which is being caused by their high use of fossil fuels. We have to realize that we cannot have it all and that our actions have consequences (even if these consequences are not immediately apparent). We have to make a choice.

At first glance it was hard to believe. I mean there’s no way that a fire should be able to move that fast right? It almost seemed like a scene from the bible or some dramatic movie about natural disasters. Most likely staring the Rock. Wait they already did that. And even worse, this is the real deal. The fires in Paradise brought to light the all too real concern of the climate crisis’ affect on regions of the planet not by the coast. This is the future that awaits us if we continue to not be proactive. Anthropomorphic climate change has doubled the wildfires in California since 1984. The fire in paradise left 153,000 acres of scorched earth, burnt houses and 85 people dead in its wake. Through a devastating mixture of fast winds, lack of communication, anthropomorphic climate change, and a greedy electric company, California got a taste of what’s to come in the future. As prof. Ken mentioned, 4/5 of the largest fires recorded in California’s history have occurred in the past decade. Seeing the barren wasteland that resulted from the negligence of PG&E’s old equipment and all of the people effected by the fire is reprehensible. Hearing about the girl’s grandfather passing away in the fire was hard to do because it was clear just how devastated she was. The Climate Crisis is affecting our planet in visible ways, not in the future, but right now. Australia is currently in the middle of one of the largest ever recorded fires. Millions of acres have burned. This cannot be allowed to continue. The saddest part about this fire from my perspective is not that the fire was handled poorly, but the fact that if PG&E had replaced/repaired their equipment on time, the fire likely wouldn’t have occurred.

`When I began watching the documentary, Fire in Paradise, I thought it was unfair to solely blame the power company for the ignition of Camp Fire. However, after getting into the documentary, I found it quite upsetting that PG&E continued to run a power line that was already aged, especially during such high winds. Their recklessness led to the most destructive fire in California.
        <br><br>

Of course Paradise residents were unprepared for such a disaster. They were accustomed to wildfires in the area. This incident was unprecedented because climate change has made wildfires bigger and stronger in recent years. The documentary mentioned that 10 out of 20 of the most destructive fires happened in the last 4 years. It seems like only a matter of time before something like this happens again. Hopefully, there will be more money invested in wider roads for efficient evacuation; watching all the chaos and helplessness made me anxious. I was both disturbed and engaged by the end of the documentary.

In response to you, I felt the beginning of the movie did not really blame PG&E at all. The beginning of the movie seemed to place the blame on the firefighters in my opinion. All the introduction showed was how quickly the fire was moving. In fact, it wasn’t really until the very end of the documentary that I felt PG&E’s role was criticized (as it should have been). Up until that point, the movie was not blameful at all. 
<br><hr>

Man, when that firefighter said, “This has the potential to be a large incident,” he wasn’t kidding. When the other firefighter said he thought nothing of it, I could totally identify with his feelings. It was cold and windy and who could have expected that. What was most surprising was seeing the time stamps on the film and seeing how quickly the fire had grown in so little time. This was followed up by the explanation that they couldn’t really tell much about the fire because the planes couldn’t fly. They were too busy evacuating people and making sure everyone was safe.
<br><hr>

The fact that they told people the fire was miles away from Paradise is extremely disappointing. The one lady who kept calling to confirm it was by Concow was right in making sure but unfortunately she kept telling people they would be fine when they would not. Eventually the entire town of Paradise would need to be evacuated. 
<br><hr>

The man from the University of Berkeley stated that human caused climate change has doubled the amount of wild fires. That is horrible. Looking at the impact wildfires have on communities and knowing that we are responsible is shameful. Did you watch the part about evacuating the hospital? I can’t even imagine being a nurse/doctor and having to do that in an orderly fashion. 
<br><hr>

I certainly understand why the firefighters were not upfront about what was going on, but it does seem like many of the citizens were completely unaware of the severity of what was happening. The people who were confused why we weren’t just charging the fire and putting it out, I identify with that. I would be asking the same thing if I were in a fire but I know it has scientific reasoning. Why the Cal Fire people didn’t enable the code red I literally do not understand. Christina having to leave her mom is horrible, but in her mom’s defense she hadn’t been told to evacuate.
<br><hr>
I agree completely with you in that PG&E's lack of initiative was not touched on enough in this film, but instead focused more on the fire department's role. Had they decided to cut power initially, this fire could've been well contained and much less detrimental. I will never understand why people/companies refuse to play it safe rather than sorry, especially when dealing with the lives of countless individuals. Greed really is the root of all evil.  I also feel like there was not proper communication to the public/residents of that area from the fire department. Evacuation should've began sooner given the wind gusts in the area as well as the amount of people surrounding the fire. Regardless, the effects of this fire were of course severely heightened due to climate change and serves as yet another sign that we are currently in the midst of a serious crisis.

<br><hr>

Being from the East Coast, I really did not know about the Camp Fire until watching this documentary. The destruction caused was unprecedented, and seemed like something out of a movie with its "30-40 foot" flames. I am upset for all of the people who lost loved ones and their homes, and wish well to those still recovering from this catastrophe. 
        <br><br>

I agree that it was a pretty messed up move on PG&E's part, because had they fixed the power line issue, many acres of land and lives could have been spared. However, I do not think creating more evacuation routes is a good idea. It sends a message that we are just complacent with these ravenous fires, and instead of doing something to combat such harsh conditions, we are just adapting to them and accepting them. We are accepting more chaos and death in the future instead of doing something to prevent such events from happening in the first place. Taking action to reverse the damage we have done to the climate is extremely urgent, and should be the main focus instead of adding more evacuation routes, which will barely be used on a regular day and cost a lot of money.

I wasn’t planning on finishing the whole documentary in one sitting, but I did. I was vaguely aware of the fires and the PG&E drama, but I never really could have imagined how crazy these fires were. The documentary does a great job of showing a personal and macro view of the fire. For me, the combination of the two really opened my eyes to the gravity of the situation. Especially, Jordan Huff who I feel like I would have reacted exactly like. I also enjoyed how the documentary begins in chronological order and adds people in when they become more involved. The more they discuss their experience the more shocking but necessary their actions become such as the lady running through fire or the firefighter bulldozing cars for 24 hours. 
        <br><br>

 The film also makes an interesting point about how PG&E only fixes electric lines when they break rather than when they could no longer optimally perform. One of the commentators discussed how astonishing that instead of replacing or maintaining these electric lines, they shut down electricity for whole communities. Some communities around my own hometown have had their power shut down. My roommate’s dad had to buy a generator to keep the fridge running during the shutdown or else their food will go bad. As someone who has lived in California their whole life, the film made me become more aware of the tangible effects due to climate change.

I agree that the film was incredibly captivating, and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I might've. I also liked the chronological order of the film, and that the experiences of the real citizens of Paradise were featured. As the people featured in the documentary discussed their personal stories of the fire, I felt like I could really put myself in their shoes to feel a bit better what the experience must have been like. I believe this aspect of the film really added to it's genuineness and allowed for it's points to be made in a much deeper way.

        <br><br>

In addition, I would like to add that I, like your roommate's dad, have also had my power shut off at my home due high fire danger. This experience, along with my watching of the film, has really made me more aware of the fire risk many of us in California live with, and how much more risk there will be as the effects of climate change continue to take hold of our state. As Ken stated in this lecture, 4 out of California's 5 worst wildfires occurred from 2010-2019, and I fear that due to anthropogenic climate change, even larger fires will begin to break out in this decade.

When something bad happens, in this case something extremely tragic, it is easy to blame others as a way of coping. I found it slightly understandable, but still very disappointing how people were so quick to blame authority members for some fatalities and excessive destruction. The documentary showed police evacuating homes while wearing no extra protective clothing, a 911 dispatcher fighting back tears while telling stories of that day, many firefighters driving through burning streets, and one firefighter literally bulldozing through burning cars to clear the way; all of them were doing their best to save the people who in turn are blaming them for not doing more. Maybe alerts could have gone out sooner or an evacuation plan should have been more thorough but that all is much easier to say after the fact and not literally in the heat of the moment. I understand the necessity for a better evacuation plan, but realistically I do not think the city could have done much more ahead of time. Should cities spend millions of dollars widening streets and making them evacuation friendly for a disaster that might happen “once in a half century” as suggested in the documentary? Maybe directly after something like this happens people would say yes, until a little time goes on and they find out that the money would likely be coming from them. 
        <br><br>

This documentary was extremely effective in evoking an emotional response from viewers and displaying just how serious climate change consequences are. The statistics from the documentary are what resonated most with me: 153,000 acres burned, 85 casualties, 30,000 people losing homes, and an incredible 50,000 people escaping safely.  On a side note, Ken, I am ready for this class to start being a little less TOTALLY DEPRESSING! This truly was one of the hardest things I have ever had to watch. I had to pause the video multiple times because I found the raw footage and personal stories not only terrifying, but very upsetting. I completely understand the purpose of us watching this film this week, but I am very ready to start seeing some positivity moving forward in the class and with climate change in general.

I do think people are stuck in the "what if" stage regarding the fires. "What if they had sent out an alert earlier?" "What if the power line was fixed?" and while these are all good questions, they seek to ignore the real reason for the humongous fire: climate change. It was even stated in the video that without the extreme conditions climate change provides, the fire would have been manageable, and no issue would have arisen. It is because of climate change and its effects on the environment that these fires have grown to be deadly. The heartbreaking account of the nurse who ran through fire in order to save her own life is just one of the many examples of why we need to update protocol for fire-prone areas, or put WAY more effort into saving our planet. It is awful to know that this is just one of the many climate disasters happening worldwide and that so many life-threatening disasters are on their way.
        <br><br>


The updated evacuation plan and its failures were especially hard to watch. Knowing that the spread of misinformation/lack of information worked to kill many people, like the mother who didn't leave because there was no mandate to go, really struck me. It was like seeing so much of modern technology fail and realizing that we are helpless against the whims of nature. If we have the capacity to warn an entire town of a life-threatening fire but choose not to, why is it even there? That was haunting. The roads that couldn't contain everyone are a conundrum. The man in the video defends the roads being so narrow stating that this was a "once in a century" occurrence. But with the effects of climate change rapidly appearing before our eyes, how can we be sure that these tragedies won't happen once a year? Once a decade? Because we know they are coming, and they are coming soon, I really do believe it is time to look at the emergency protocol and prepare for the absolute worst, as we know it is on the way. I really do not believe we can feign ignorance anymore on the disasters caused by climate change, as it is time to face the consequences of our actions.

        <br><br>

Also, I'm really ready for this class to become more positive!! :(

<br><hr>
I agree that it was unfair for people to immediately blame the authority members for this tragedy. Although I do believe there should have been mass notifications sent to every household within the vicinity about the evacuation, as it is always better to be safe than sorry, I think it’s harsh to accuse the police and dispatch in this situation when they were simply trying their best to protect people. There were many factors that contributed to the production of such a horrible fire, but some aspects- like the limited roads- were simply beyond the police’s control. It’s a natural human tendency to immediately search for a scapegoat in light of disaster, but the real culprit of the severity of this fire is much more complex than just PG&E or the Paradise Police. Instead, the blame lies upon all humans who have been contributing to climate change, especially over the past 60 years. This has resulted in such devastating fires, and according to the film, wildfires have doubled across Western United States since 1984. We all know it will only continue to get worse from here.

        <br><br>

While watching this film, I was astonished as I learned about the destruction from  this fire, which occurred less than two years ago, for the very first time. I also agree with Abigail in the way she mentions how effective this documentary was in evoking emotional responses- my roommate and I were almost brought to tears as we watched the young girl describe how her grandfather’s wheelchair was found among the ashes from the fire. I am definitely hoping for some positive energy in this class soon as well!

Although the film puts a human face on the wildfires in California as a result of the climate crisis, I had not been able to imagine the widespread of the Paradise fire until the film compared it to the size of Chicago. The documentary stated that the area burned throughout the Paradise fire was in fact the size of Chicago. Being born in this city, I was in awe to hear this statistic. It is incredibly hard to imagine this to be true as I have a good perception of the vastness of my home. With this in mind, if the fire were to have hit a city with the a similar population of Chicago, the consequences on humans and their homes would be catastrophic. Now that climate change is hitting home everywhere, it is not unlikely for this possibility to occur. If a fire were to hit in a more densely populated area than Paradise, roadways and exits would be even more packed than those within the video. Therefore, escape routes would be even more unaccessible, costing thousands of lives. As we can see, modern wildfires are rapidly growing in size, like Hiltner has made clear in this lecture. However, fire departments are not equipped to battle their velocities, as seen in the video and in current Australian fire. There are more safety measures that needs to be taken than what are put in place, for we can not underestimate the anger of mother nature.

This film did the same thing for me. Although I have experienced fires in my life, I had never seen one up close. This film showed the awful reality that is a wildfire. I could never in my life have imagined how truly horrific it is inside a fire. Knowing that it is a very plausible reality for us in this area to live through makes me deeply terrified and I had a hard time getting through the film. Hearing testimonials of those who have lost a loved one also really got me. This film did a good job, as you stated, at putting the fire into perspective. It makes me scared for a fire to happen while we are here at school, as I am now questioning the methods and plans the Santa Barbara Fire Department has in place in case of such a catastrophic emergency. You also said “for we can not underestimate the anger of mother nature” and I once again agree. It is time to understand that anything can happen and we, as a community and a country, need to prepare for the worst and do everything we can to acknowledge that the consequences of the climate crisis are coming and we need to change our ways of life.

Watching the documentary, Fire in Paradise, left me extremely devastated. I know Ken has said at least twice in lecture that the depressing material we have will only last for a certain period before we encounter solutions and what we can do about it, but this was a tough watch and really hit home. Personally, I am from the East Bay Area, as I am sure others lots of us in this class, and am well aware of the dangers and consequences of the wildfires. However, I never saw how much destruction was left behind by the Camp Fire in Paradise nor how far the fire spread from its origin. My heart truly goes to all those affected by these fires, and other disasters heightened by climate crisis to the point where any level of resources and preparation seems minute; and my deepest condolences to anyone who knows someone who has lost their lives to them. My city came close to evacuation this past Fall when fires were roaring in Northern California. PG&E had already shut down the power, which offered me some relief. Then, I remember going on social media to a friend from home frantically posting that her father refused to evacuate from their home when the fire posed a threat to their area,  similar to Kristina in the documentary. Fortunately, the fires did not reach them and all of them and their home remained safe, but there are so many more people like Kristina who had to make the choice to save themselves. Obviously, while all of this was occuring I was here in Santa Barbara. All I could do was constantly search Google and see the current danger zones on maps; I was constantly in contact with my family members and friends warning them to leave immediately if anything changed. The anxiety and fear I had during that time was horrible, and I was nowhere near the fires. On top of this, fires in Southern California near Los Angeles were inching closer and closer to my sisters university. While I should have been focusing on school and my own life, I feared for everyone elses who could potentially be in danger.

        <br><br>

After watching the documentary, I have an even deeper appreciation and utmost respect for every single firefighter and first responder who, with no hesitation, committed to their jobs and did their absolute best to help anyone they could. I cannot imagine the bravery it took to drive a bulldozer not fitted for those extreme conditions through the mountains and physically flip burning cars out of the road to pave the way for others. The pain those answering 911 calls must have felt when they knew that not everyone could be saved; it seems so unreal. It must be hard to look back and feel that they did not do enough or were not prepared enough for this fire, and place blame on themselves, but how could they prepare for something this catastrophic. Like last week's film, Before the Flood, I was near tears throughout most of the documentary. This could easily be me or my family and friends within the next few years if, and when, the fires continue to grow beyond anything we have seen. As mentioned by Ken, watching documentaries like these showing the real implications that the climate crisis is having today. This fire alone should be enough to prove that this is not an over exaggeration created by scientists. We are living in a climate crisis, and it is our job to be apart of the solution so our generation can at least have a chance at a future.

I absolutely agree with your opinion. When the fire happened in Santa Barbara, I did the exact same thing with you--searching Google and seeing the maps. I understand that there are so many people have the similar feelings with me, which bring me confidence that we could use our emotional bonds to bring people together and really focus and restrain the climate change.

The documentary film “Fire in Paradise” describes the actual fire that happened in Concow and spread to Paradise as well as real situations of millions of citizens. It incorporates the actual videos records, phone calls, and interviews with 911 polices, firefighters, and people who personally experienced the fire. The film utilizes a timeline method to help present the true development of the event and show the increasing severity of the wildfire. It’s unbelievable that the fire spread so quickly and burnt forests near the road 2 hours since ignition. Along with the storyline, there are experts and narrator telling us the climate change in California such as drought, shorter precipitation period, and hotter summer. According to one firefighter, the fire even defied the gravity and spread to all angle, which is definitely a terrifying description. The victims of that fire expressed their strong emotion and scare as well as how their lives were threatened.
        <br><br>

One extraordinarily powerful advantage of documentaries comparing to films is that documentary could directly present the actual situation to those people who never experience the disaster themselves. Honestly, I think Fire in Paradise is more influential than Before the Flood because it shows that real catastrophes because of anthropogenic climate change just happen around us, near our home. Not only people living in California, but people around the world could get alarmed and pay great attention to this issue.

I feel like this film does an incredibly effective job of utilizing imagery to describe people's desperation. The way that the story progresses is like watching a thriller except that you know that this really happened. The fact that a documentary can look like an apocalyptic movie is worrisome and does not paint a good picture for the future. Having lived in southern California during these events, I was familiar with the Paradise fire but I was not aware of the scale. Same thing with the Australia fires. I am ashamed of my lack of information and wish that I had been alert to these sooner.

One aspect that we have not covered yet, but that I certainly hope we cover in class is that of how to stay informed. In our society where partisan politics and bias have corrupted most forms of public media, how do we stay informed about climate change? As a student and worker, I don't have time to watch several news reports in order to corroborate what is real. What is a good way to stay informed once we are no longer in this class? I feel as if I have a solid idea of what I can do to help mitigate my impact on the planet as an individual, but not necessarily of what is currently happening.

I agree with you about the use of imagery being extremely effective during this film. This film affected me deeply and I wanted to cry about the impact the fire had caused on human lives and the town. We have been learning about the strong winds and hotter air that has attributed to climate change; however, we had never really discussed the issue using people who had gone through the heartache of our horribly evolving world. People don't understand that any fire that occurs in this century has a larger chance of having more detrimental impacts on society and towns because of the weather conditions: people in the town of Paradise were ignorant and did not communicate enough with the citizens. 

        <br><br>

I really like how you pointed out the idea of staying informed. I hadn't even heard of this fire until I watched the video. I believe that if people were informed daily with this type of emotional and fast-paced video of the effects of climate change, that people would start making a difference. I for one am not educated or up to date about current news which makes me not fear climate change as much; however, after watching this film it makes one think and fear the effects. What if the winds were stronger a few weeks ago when there was a small wildfire in Santa Barbara? It is a terrifying thought that we could have ended up like the people in the town of Paradise but it is not an impossible thought due to what we have done to our climate. As Ken stated that this film “puts a face on climate crisis” it allows us to realize that this isn't a far off idea that one day the Earth will become uninhabitable, but it is occurring now and people are facing serious repercussions from past mistakes.

The film, “Fire in Paradise,” does a great job of dramatically reporting upon the most destructive fire in California’s history. The film was constructed in a way in which the audience can easily develop an emotional effect when watching the film. This was accomplished by including the experiences told from the first-hand responders themselves.   When watching this film I was alarmed as I began to think about how scary it is to think about the fact that these ordinary people in the film nearly faced death. This film makes viewers realize including me, that escape routes and precautions need to be made and thought about especially during this time of the progressing climate crisis. In the part of the film where the woman talks about her account of being trapped in her car as flames burst around her, and her only option suggested by her husband when she called was to get out of the car and run into the dangerous fire. I can not imagine being in that situation and just knowing that your life might be over at that moment. The accounts through this film and just watching it in general, I became quite frustrated as well, wondering if our evacuation plans and emergency alert systems are sufficient enough. I understand at the time the fire department and other officials did all they could to their best ability in that exact time and situation, although I think this destruction should serve as a big eye-opener to the changes our society needs to take in multiple aspects. I am afraid that there are not enough people watching films like this one and reading articles that report and inform on accounts like these, not realizing this ongoing issue of the climate crisis until it eventually and unfortunately dramatically affects us all.

Yeah, I definitely agree with you in terms of how even though the firefighters and officials did exactly what they were supposed to do,  and to an extent, the people of Paradise had a plan thought out in case of an emergency. Yet that was nowhere near enough since they suffered heavy casualties. One point that an Officer brought up in the documentary was that they knew that there was only one main road out of Paradise, and in case of an emergency, each zone of the town would have to take a turn getting out. Thus, there was no need to open the road further because that plan was already in place and it would cost a lot of money to build roads. Bringing this to the attention of the government would get it rejected. This Camp fire, however, surrounded the place forcing everyone to leave at once, making the devised plan unusable. With climate change in place, droughts and heavy winds are surely more to be expected, and thus it is crucial to make evacuations more efficient and safe. But that costs money, and people generally don't like paying higher taxes for "hypothetical" situations. Hopefully, after this disaster, people will realize that events like these can really become a reality and be willing to change.

I agree with you that proper precautions need to be made. Watching real people, specifically hearing the story about how young girl's how he grandfather tragically passed away with a hose nearby him made me tear up. Additionally, hearing Ken's own personal story about a fire scare right here in Santa Barbara made this it feel all too real. As much as it scares me to imagine it, a fire like the one in paradise can happen at any moment which makes me wonder if we are prepared if it does. I felt frustrated as well watching the miscommunications like dispatchers not getting proper information and residents not even receiving a proper warning or evacuation notice. There was no excuse for PG&E's negligence and learning they've caused multiple tragedies previously shows how corrupt these big corporations are. However, climate change plays a bigger role in this. Each wildfire is getting bigger and bigger like the most recent in Australia which have burned 17.9 million acres. While the authorities did an amazing job with the extreme circumstances, it was clear they underestimated Campfire. It is crazy to me that we are past trying to debate over whether or not climate change is real as it is the new norm. It feels like everyday we are sending prayers to a new place in the world.

My closest experience with the wildfire was that my homestay told me to pack my luggage and my homestay told me it was highly possible that we need to be evacuated due to the wildfire. I was worried and terrified, but luckily we did not evacuate due to the wind changed its direction which led the fire to another direction. I was scared and after watching this documentary that I cannot imagine what did those people go through; especially for the people who had lost their loved ones during the fire. To be honest, before watching this documentary,  I have never noticed the process of evacuating from the wildfire-affected area was that devastating and difficult. And the paradise's fire is only one of the major fires in recent California history.
<br><br>
People need to be prepared for this kind of disasters, some people in the documentary did not know what to do during the evacuation.  The evacuation was not effective enough, and the police did not report to the people immediately -- the message was sent too late that there was barely any time to prepare. The fire in Paradise would cost less if the police were prepared and the people were noticed.
<br><br>
All in all is the increased temperature in California caused this fire and any other major fires in recent years. To drive less and release less carbon dioxide into the air is the solution to change the climate crisis here.

As someone who has been in a similar situation like you, I also agree on the evacuation process. My hometown was to be evacuated but for most of us, we weren't informed from an Amber Alert or siren, we were informed with RED CODE, like the Campfire, which most of us weren't signed up for. For some residents of my hometown, it was too late. I was lucky that the fire didn't reach far enough to my home as well.


<br><hr>
Personally, I have been lucky enough to never have to have been evacuated from my home because of a natural disaster. The worst I’ve had is having school canceled because of smoke or flooding. To me, the danger of fire has always felt distant. I’ve never thought that it might happen to me one day. I 100% agree that we need to implement better evacuation and warning systems. In addition to this, I think we need to educate more about the dangers of natural disasters, specifically fires, in California. Before I watched this documentary I didn’t understand how big this issue really is and that it's getting worse and worse as time goes on. Many of the people who lost their lives in the Paradise fires didn’t know how big and close it really was. I think when fires and other natural disasters happen, most people think “oh it will never happen to me though” until it does, and then its too late. I think if people were more educated about the real danger of these fires and how common they are becoming, they would be more cautious and concerned. Its a bit different in the case of the Paradise fires because many of the residents weren’t told to evacuate, and that is the fault of the local authorities. It really isn't that difficult to implement a better warning system, especially when people's lives are at stake.

This film brought me to tears. I had definitely heard of the paradise fire but had not seen it from that perspective.  Fires like that are not normal. Even with the pg&e incidents and high winds, a fire like that is not normal. It blew my mind when they said it was moving 80 football fields a minute. It is so hard to think that this is going on in our world and people still are refusing climate change and are refusing to make a change to help. In the last 10 years, California has seen some of the worst fires in its history, and climate change is a big factor. This is a terrifying glimpse into the feature unless we start acting now. This major devastation affected so many families in ways I could never imagine. My heart goes out to all of them. To think that this same thing is going on in Australia at this very moment and is doing even more damage is devastating. When will people realize that this is a result of climate change, this is a result of human actions.

I went through the same emotions as you did during this film. It was a mix of shock and devastation for those living in and around Paradise. This film did an amazing job of using pathos to make their point clear -- the climate crisis must be taken seriously. I think what impacted me most was the cell phone videos, as well as the body cam videos, from first responders and the people of Paradise. Although we’ll never know how they felt in the moment, these videos definitely provided us with pure, raw emotion, giving us a general idea of the state of terror they were in. In only 4 hours since ignition, Paradise burned down. In 4 hours, 85 people lost their lives and 30,000 people lost their homes. In almost the same duration as an NFL football game, an entire town was completely burned down to the ground. If that realization doesn’t motivate people to take action, I don’t know what will. I try to put myself in their shoes, and I just can’t imagine it. Just like you said, people in Australia are currently going through the same devastation as the people in Paradise went through. These huge wildfires are becoming the norm, and that is just unacceptable.

“Fire in Paradise” is extremely emotional and definitely pulls on the heartstrings of the viewer. In doing this, it also brings attention to the seriousness of fires, specifically fire safety and wildfire response plans. I would argue that the devastation of the “Camp Fire” was made even worse because Butte County did not have an adequate evacuation plan in place. This meant that firefighters then had to direct more of their attention and manpower to ensure that residents were able to reach safety rather than focusing on containing the fire. This only added to the panic of the situation which made evacuating considerably more difficult. I feel like that county, being in the remote and vegetation surrounded location it’s in, should have put more of an importance on proactive solutions for when a fire arises. 
<br><br>


While it is easy to blame the fire department for not alerting the residents of Paradise in time, I don’t believe that all the blame lies on the fire department. It’s hard to understand how someone could see ashes falling on their house and smoke completely engulfing their blue skies and not be concerned about their safety. I feel like it’s almost irresponsible to not begin evacuation procedures at that point. What I especially don’t understand is the people who remained in their houses despite receiving alerts mandating evacuations. This almost portrays the negligence that people have to the power of destruction that a fire contains. This is scary to think especially since climate change is leading to more intense and prolonged droughts which creates more fuels for more intense wildfires. The occurrence of atypical fires with similar conditions to the “Camp Fire”, such as the Thomas fire, Tubbs fire, and Carr fire, will only increase as global warming drags on. This said, the only true solution to negate these fires is to take into consideration our actions as a society and how they’re propelling the climate crisis.

I agree that the ethos in "Fire in Paradise" are strong and they do a great job of making the audience sympathetic towards the residents of Paradise, CA. However, the audience should also be worried about themselves because this crisis will affect everyone on the planet. I like how you mentioned the responsibility the people had to evacuate themselves rather than wait on authorities. In the same way, do you think that if we see blazing fires, devastating hurricanes, and ice caps melting we should be concerned about our own safety and not wait on authorities to tell us we should change our ways of living to ensure survival of the planet? I think one day that future generations will say " Its hard to understand how they could have seen all these things happening around them and they still neglected to act." 
<br><br>
While the "Camp fire" was not a natural fire since it was due to equipment of PG&E we should be reminded that wildfires have been apart of woodland ecosystems. "Wildland fires spawn a period of rebirth and vigor in post-fire environments by removing dead materials and by releasing nutrients back to the environment that are locked up in mature plants and organic litter." -California Coastal Commission If we were taking care of the planet the way we should then the only fires we would hear about are these natural wildfires that replenish the soil. However, we have seen some of the largest fires in history only in the past ten years. How is the planet supposed to regain its natural cycles while we are constantly polluting it? 
<br><br>
With all these fires the climate crisis should be a hot topic.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said about how the devastation was made even worse because of the inadequate evacuation plan. They definitely should have focused on keeping the citizens safe rather than trying to put out the fire first. I do understand that they wanted to cut it off at the root, but they should’ve paid more attention to helping each individual get out of there. It’s interesting how you also say that the people should’ve been aware of the situation and began evacuation. I agree with that, but also could understand from their point of view how they might truly not know how to react to the situation. 

<br><br>

Also, I really like how you put that the film “pulls on the heartstrings of the viewer”.  It truly broke my heart to listen to Jordan Huff talk about how the fires caused her grandfather’s passing and how his death affected her. The fires affect so many people, from losing their home to losing a loved one. Up until now, I had pictured the climate crisis as a problem on a grand scale, affecting a mass of people. Watching the film made me realize that while it is a global problem, it also affects the individual.
<br><hr>
When watching the film "Fire in Paradise," I also felt the emotional weight of the civilian's anecdotes. The scene that stirred up the most emotions was when the young twenty one year old female told the audience that her grandfather did not make it, and that she could see the remnants of his rocking chair and gardening hose. These real stories need to be shouted from the rooftops to underline the terrifying effects of fires. Much of social media jokes around about fires and do not realize the severity of them. In fact, around the end of fall quarter, many Gauchos were joking around about the Thomas fires and how they'd wish Santa Barbara had another fire to delay the week of finals. However, after watching this short film, I wish I could go back and remind those who made these comments of the actual severity of fires. 
<br><br>


I agree with you that it was not 100% the fire department's fault of this disastrous event. I know that the phone operators who told citizens that everything was "fine" feel awful of the misinterpretation of information, but they simply did not know. I agree with one of the authority figures that at the end of the day, it is completely up to the individual to have the "flight" instinct. With seeing clouds of ashes and skies that were filled with orange and red hues, how could you not evacuate? Even if an authority said it was under control, I believe it should be a natural human response to realize that you are in danger and you must leave immediately. People have this same ignorance towards climate change, as you said. Even though it is obvious that the climate is changing, the globe is warming, and sea levels are rising, people still choose to ignore the cold hard facts and not accept climate change. I believe this is due to false news controlled by fossil fuel corporations to maintain their billion-dollar industry. It's sad to see that greed and selfishness will inevitably be the end of our planet, unless we all do something to make a change.

<br><hr>

I agree that “Fire in Paradise” is emotional and powerful and makes many people realize how wildfires are impacting California. You mention that people start the evacuation process so late and some people even stay in their houses, I agree that this is incredibly stupid and that so many people still have negliangce towards these catastrophic fires that are burning many homes and killing people. I love the point you made saying that fires will only increase and the only way we can stop these fires from getting bigger out from the actions in our society. I strongly agree with this and believe it is time that our generation takes action in helping solve this climate issue before it's too late.

<br><hr>
This documentary is definitely emotional, especially because of the interviews of people who had first hand experience with the fires. All of the technical numbers were astonishing, but it is easy to overlook the large amounts of houses and people that were lost; but when you hear a girl cry over the loss of her grandfather and another speak about her stubborn mother who tragically died, the stories get personal and thus more impactful. 
<br><br>

I think this tragic event was a combination of climate change, negligence from pn&g, and inadequate evacuation plan, and the misinformation given to people as well as people’s own stubbornness to evacuate. Climate change greatly worsened the situation, because normally a power line would fall, cause a fire, and that fire would then be put out; but because of the extremely dry season and high winds, this extremely fast fire was created. PN&G is also to blame; and as one interviewee in the documentary said if it weren't a company but a single person, they would be in jail. Although the company denies it, they knowingly kept their outdated transmission lines because once again profits are the priority to businesses, and thus they put everyone around their lines in danger. The police officers, firefighters, and those in charge are heroes and helped many people escape. Yet, they are also to blame for misinformation that the fires weren’t going to affect paradise, and their inadequate evacuation plans. The people should’ve been notified of the severity sooner, the notification system should’ve been completely set up, and the evacuation plan should’ve been thought out for every situation possible. Someone (I believe a police officer) stated that people are responsible for their own safety, and yes I understand that more people should’ve gotten themselves out of harm's way, but many of those who died were plausibly too old to help themselves, or they were still under the idea that the fire wasn’t destructive. 
<br><br>

We must create plans and put legislation in place to help avoid fires of this severity, but I agree that the most useful thing we can do is take action and fight climate change.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with you that this piece was very emotional. I went into the movie expecting it to be hard to watch because of my familiarity with the Camp fire and how incredibly devastating it was. As you said the movie brought in the seriousness of the issue by bringing in real life examples. There is something about an individual explaining a story that happened to them. It is as if you embark on the emotional journey with them which somehow leads you to understanding the severity of the situation. 
 <br><br>

I am interested by your point which you stated that devastation of the Camp fire was made worse because Bute county didn’t have an adequate evacuation plan. I somewhat disagree, from the point of the fire fighters and police it seemed as if they had plans for evacuation, but when it got to the level of evacuation needed for the Camp fire it was beyond their control. The only way at that level of severity that they could have saved more lives is if they had better ways to get out of the city. As they state in the video, it is quite unrealistic for people to put money towards something that isn’t presently happening. Much like the climate crisis in general, people in general will not make a change until the issue is right there in front of them threatening their lives. 
 <br><br>

In response to your comment on not understanding how people could stay when they were receiving evacuation notices. To me it is a way for an individual to deny the crisis and what is taking place. I vividly remember the police come knocking on my door telling my family to evacuate my house, and for the next hour my mom continued vacuuming the house while my sister and I were yelling “mom it’s not going to matter if our house is clean when our house burns down!” Once again this represents another parallel between climate change in the fire. People often deny the issue because they are scared and don’t want to admit that is real. 
 <br><br>

The two facts that really resonated with about the fire was that the fire in Australia is four times bigger than all of the fifteen biggest fires in California in the past 10 years COMBINDE. FOUR TIMES!
 <br><br>

The line that really has a lasting impact in the film was at the end of when asked “could it be worse?” And the guy replied, “the answer is yes.”

<br><hr>
I would have to agree that the approach taken by PBS in the creation of "Fire in Paradise" is highly reliant upon emotion and the anecdotes of those specifically affected. More often than not, news reports/outlets can seem to overlook individuals affected by events. and present it to viewers as numbers or some remote activity. In building a relationship with the audience, this was not the case, as there was such a heavy emphasis placed upon the social impact of the fires. Common are the decisions made by people in power in regards to individuals or their constituents as numbers or ideas, rather than real people who are being affected. This can be seen through a multitude of avenues including economic and social policies.
 <br><br>
That being said; did the fire departments of the affected areas do everything they could given current resources, possibly, but did they do everything possible, no. In the creation and anticipation of a real and what would be referred to as "normal" fire situation, the plan could have worked. As expressed in that of Paradise and Butte counties, people were evacuated based on region or as information became available. While this was meant to help ease congestion in the eyes of the plan as the fire department had stated before, this wasn't a 'routine' fire, and should have been treated as such in regard to citizens in the two counties. While hesitant in releasing evacuation orders initially, the congestion experienced as people rushed for their lives could have also been lessened if citizens were told to leave earlier. This could have been a preventative measure taken in combatting the effects of late notification, that further plagued and drained resources in combatting the fire, as you had above mentioned. 
 <br><br>
In regard to how you mention citizen response to a natural disaster, first and foremost has to be knowledge about where you live and how preventative measures are being taken, as well as how to act. As you've also mentioned given the circumstances fo the residents living condition along much brush and vegetation, and what the county could have done, it comes down to the idea of interest. Whether that be monetary, and/or political (and hopefully social), how as a society how AND when we acknowledge these combatting these problems.

<br><hr>
I agree that this film was extremely emotional. Particular when the 911 calls got played back. People calling for help only to be told that no one would be able to save them. Or when they showed the body cam footage from first responders. Or when the hospital had to be evacuated and people didn’t know what to do and had nowhere to go. I think what’s really sad about all of this is that the city officials knew they did not have proper roads that could safely evacuate everyone. Yet it seemed like residents in the town did not know that if a fire like this happened they would have a hard time evacuating because of gridlock. I think like the article this week mentioned, for so long people of California knew climate change was a real issue yet considered it something that could never happen to them. Unfortunately for the town of Paradise this did happen to them and city officials knew that if it did that it was going to be explosive.
 <br><br>



 I agree that many factors came into play that caused this to be so devastating. I don’t believe that anyone is particularly to blame. I have noticed that just within the last few years’ fires have only gotten worse. And at this point every city that is in a high-risk fire zone needs to have adequate safety plans set up. I think what we be the biggest injustice to come from all of the lives lost is that other cities don’t learn something from the paradise fire. I believe at this point everyone in California can agree that the fires have only gotten worse and it would be naive to think that it will not continue to get worse. I agree that the true solution to all of this is to look at our actions as a society and how we all contribute to climate change.

This is horrifying. This is literally like an inferno. 
 <br><br>
Not as a native in CA, I have no idea of how intense and terrible the wildfire will be before. Being told through the news and seeing all those images of red flames and embers cannot give me direct emotional relatability to how desperate people are. However, this film makes me quiver and my eyes are filled with tears and anger. 
 <br><br>
I think most of us are majorly shaken by how fast and intense this Paradise Fire spreads. In fact, it’s not just our audience, but all the officers from local police, 911, or CalFire. Only within 4 hours, we witnessed the fire rushed down from Concow to Paradise and burnt the initially peaceful town down. Happening so fast, this fire is not normal in the history of Paradise. According to the professionals in the film, climate change induced by human activities seriously changes the weather of CA. The fire season is much longer; summer is hotter, drier, and less humidity. And the winter rain comes later than usual. In other words, “Human doubles fires.” The most obvious expression of climate change in this fire is the unusual spreading speed and intensity: The wind aloft lofts the embers and is much stronger than the surface wind, which creates a lot of paths for the fire to throw fireballs everywhere. 
 <br><br>
There are several things that made me really angry by the way, and I want to ask some questions about them. First, why there is no plan ahead for the whole town evacuation? You may have excuses such as no funding for widening the road, but what about the next step? They could have alternatives. All I want to say is that they don’t want to put so much money and pay much attention to a thing that maybe has one-time utility in the whole century. Second, the delayed notification. Through the course of the video, I was most confused by the complex explanation of how the local safety department get in touch with people. They first use this system, then use that code, and blah blah….As a likely-to-be-influenced town by fires, the department should have done all of these before head! A lot of people staying in their houses have died just because of their trust in the authority! Finally, the attitude of PG&E. I just have no words to comment on the company’s behavior. The fact is the fact. If lives have been taken just because of a maintenance problem of the transmission line, so does responsibility.

I agree with your sentiment and anger against the poor planning of evacuating the whole city, but it also makes me realize that if a city in California, like Paradise, that are aware of the eminent and present dangers of wildfires did not have a perfect plan...I am sure there are other cities in California that are not prepared either. I believe that after the Paradise fire, every city in California should take a look at their response plan. This scares me because it goes to show how important proper planning is when accounting for an entire population's safety. Being from Southern California where I have experienced fire evacuations, I can also say that the notification system to evacuate when there is a fire is not a very efficient one. We did not even receive any information before seeing the smoke billowing which was very scary. For PG&E...yeah...that was pretty bad.


<br><hr>

Thank you for supplementing the topic with your real experience! I can literally imagine how horrible that feeling was when you
 <br><br>
saw the smoke and fire before the authority or relevant departments noticed you. Actually I think all these problems should be under the same name: the poor planning design. Now we know there exists a bad evacuation system, bad notification, and bad rescue plan. But what has been done to change the whole situation? So far according to the film, the officials didn't admit the mistakes they made. This is the point that brings extra sorrows to my heart...

</span></div><hr>

<p>

When I initially think about climate change, my first thought isn't wildfires. Watching this and seeing how this devastating fire had completely taken this town by surprise opened my eyes to the future of the country; we have to be prepared for this from here on out. We have to have elaborate escape plans in case of an emergency and we have to be willing to put down the money to ensure an escape plan. In the case of Paradise, not only did the town only have one road as a means of an escape, but someone had pointed out that it would be very difficult to collect funding for more lanes on a road that would be unnecessary on an average day. However, considering the climate change process that we have sprung upon ourselves, we have to be willing to take extra precautions. 
 <br><br>
It was very frustrating to me throughout the film all of the ways that a simple decision would have made on the outcome of this fire. Had there been better communication there would have been fewer casualties, had there been a better escape plan there would have been fewer casualties. The fact that nurses and doctors had to load patients into their own SUVs during the hospital evacuation proves that there was not enough time and resources for this to go smoothly. The miscommunication between the 911 operator and the fire department could have saved lives, the call service for emergencies could have saved lives. Having a plan for the elderly, who made up most of the casualties. I understand that first responders did everything that they could at the time and that hindsight is 20/20, but moving forward every town and city needs a plan. And the residents need to comply and evacuate when they're told to. This should be an eye-opener to everyone that climate change is taking over and it has affected many people, as it will many more. This is a hard reality, but if we need to adapt to the world that we are creating and hopefully in the process, people will realize we need it to change.
 <br><br>
I was aware of the Camp Fire as it was happening, but I was not prepared for all the things that I learned in this film. It was much worse than I had ever imagined, and that's how a lot of people viewed this fire and many others. They write it off as a tragic event, but this is a reality now. This is no longer the exception, but the norm if we continue down this road.

I also agree with you about my first thought of climate change didn’t include the term wildfire. Initially, I always thought of climate change as the temperatures and sea levels rising. After watching this documentary, I realized how temperature is really affecting wildfires because the fire that occurred in Paradise started due to PG&E’s old electrical towers with the addition of dry breeze. If this occurred in a big city instead of a town, I think people would barely be able to get out because the city is overcrowded with buildings and the roads would be filled with traffic. 
 <br><br>


I thought of Paradise’s evacuation plan to be not throughout enough. They were anticipating a fire sooner or later but their plans lack transportation for everyone who required it. Hearing that many elderly citizens couldn’t get out of their homes due to the fires made me question what would happen if they did get an evacuation notice at least 10-15 minutes beforehand? There was one woman who left without her mother and that broke my heart because the mother didn’t realize how bad the fire was and by the time she did, she couldn’t even get out. She trusted the officials to tell her how bad the fire was and whether she needed to leave but the faith was misplaced because it cost her life. Watching the dispatchers constantly say “Don’t worry the fire isn’t in Paradise and it’s on the north side” angered me because people were telling them I see raining ashes and they just told them not to worry about it. 

 <br><br>

I personally feel that something needs to be done about PG&E and they shouldn’t be able to get away with these crimes. I understand they want to save money and not replace the wires until the very end but as they can see, it doesn’t work that way and they need to be responsible for their actions.

I agree with you. I was stunned by this documentary, especially for the part that it describes how fearful and desperate the woman was when she was surrounded by fire and calling 911. The police who got called, however, could do nothing but comfort the woman. I can feel her helpless when the calling remained 9 minutes in silence.

<br><hr>
When I thought about climate change I never realized how we were already starting to suffer the consequences, because I also thought that climate change didn't consist of wildfires. Seeing how the wildfires and hurricanes have been significantly worse in these past few years and are only predicted to get worse is terrifying. I had heard of the fire when it was happening, but after watching this documentary I realized how I had only known about the tip of the iceberg. I was completely unaware about what caused the fire, the deaths, and the overall extent of harm done. 
 <br><br>
While there was an evacuation plan set in place, you are right there has to be more resources put in to it. The evacuation was not efficient and even though they had never seen a wild fire with multiple paths they should have had alternative evacuation plans with more roads open. I also noticed that the 911 operator and the fire department did not have very clear communication. The 911 operator didn't have a clear understanding about the extent of the fire and the fire department in no way made that clear. When people were calling in the 911 operator couldn't tell them how bad the fire was and that people should start evacuating. I think that if they would have taken the fire more seriously, more lives would have been saved and the patients at the hospital and the elderly could have had more care during this process. Most residents weren't even aware about the fact that they were supposed to be evacuating because they hadn't received the alert. The fire department had commented that not everyone had signed up for the alerts and that was the next part of their campaign, but some of those that had signed up for the alerts weren't notified, which was another flaw in their plan. 
 <br><br>
Moving forward we should all learn from this experience and improve our plan of action, because with the direction our planet seems to be headed this will not be the last natural disaster that results in such a large number of deaths.
<br><hr>

I agree completely that its frustrating seeing how this huge disaster could have been avoided. I relate this to the overall climate crisis as well. We recognize there is a problem and have the resources to avoid the problem from rapidly spreading. However, I'm afraid that we will wait too long before taking this issue seriously, just as firefighters did with the wildfires. I think this wildfire should serve as an example that we are not ready for the full extent of climate change. We should try to reduce the effects of climate change before huge devastation sweeps the Earth. The paradise fire was greater than anything firefighters could have anticipated, just as the climate crisis will be. We should try to prepare for whats to come while also aiming to prevent these disasters overall. However, this will prove to be an issue to countries as many people don't believe in this issue nor believe they should invest in it.

Fire in Paradise is the first and only documentary I have watched that breaks down the many issues leading to the 2018 California fires in and around Paradise. While the film mainly illustrates the event and damage that took place, the last couple minutes slightly seek blame. PG&E as a corporation is seemingly at fault for not taking over their power lines and equipment while the town of Paradise can be seen at fault for not issuing a warning or strong enough evacuation plan at the time. However, only briefly mentioned is the fact that climate change has brought about these major shifts in our environment making it more easy for catastrophic events like the California fires to occur. 
 <br><br>


I appreciated this film because (as recently discussed by other students last week) it depicts just how destructive these fast changes in our climate can be and unfortunately when events like this hit close to home they bring more awareness to just how real of an issue this is. While I enjoyed the overall content of this documentary including the fact that so many parts were hard to watch as they detail many of the victims and first-responders’ experiences, it is these real life depictions that I believe have the power to move people towards wanting to bring about action. While statistics on the largest fires, rising temperatures, rising sea levels and the long list of climate changes and its impacts can be eye-opening, I think what draws peoples attention most is that of seeing people close to them or whom they can relate to experience something they want no part of. The part of the film I disliked yet made sense to me as it ties back into the underlying question of “who is at fault” is that of them bringing back up a major corporation for needing to be held responsible, while I agree and am in no way stating that PG&E could have done better, I wish the greater emphasis was pushed onto how it is our climate directly affected/“helped build” the fires. However it seems it is just  human of us to want to seek someone to blame and find that one person or group that should be held to a higher standard. Again, I don’t necessarily think that people don’t have a right to believe someone should be held responsible, I simply think we push blame onto others before ourselves especially when it comes to the issue of climate change.

I wholeheartedly agree with everything you said. However, I think that holding corporations accountable is one of the key steps in our battle against climate change. Currently, corporations like PG&E are essentially unchecked in America and are always looking for new ways to increase their bottom line at the cost of our environment. From PG&E's negligence to maintain the powerline to Nestle's greedy bottling of water, to all of the offshore drillings, to all the companies behind the palm oil scheme... the point is that currently, a few people are getting rich by exploiting the environment, often in illegal ways, under the protection of corporations. PG&E is a known repeat offender for violating policies put in place to protect the environment. Who made the executive decision to ignore the warnings about the imminent failure of their equipment? Who voted to increase revenue over maintenance in their executive board? Furthermore, why is PG&E still being protected under bankruptcy? Not only will the company not have to pay for a large sum of its damages, but once it "reforms" it will most likely continue to do the same as the administration behind the company is still the same. These people should be held accountable. Our law needs to change so that the individuals behind a corporation can face charges for the corporation's misdoings. 

 <br><br>

 The fact is that climate change is a multifaced problem and as such, we need to tackle it from several different angles. As a society, we need to change our diet and lifestyle, but for other aspects, we need government involvement. As individuals, we cannot fight directly against these massive companies because they provide us with resources necessary to our survival. Rather, we need to pressure the government into regulating these companies. We should levy for a Carbon tax, as well as incentives and subsidies for the transition of companies to renewable energy. Additionally, we need to pressure congress into expanding environmental regulations and how companies can be prosecuted by them.


<br><hr>

I strongly agree with you. I think the fire in paradise actually can be prevented if the PG&E turned off the electricity that day. And the town of Paradise will have fewer damages if the police could send out a warning earlier. The decision was not decisive and was not sent to the people immediately. 

 <br><br>

Moreover, it is true that the problem goes back to ourselves due to the climate change problem. If we have protected our home in the right way, those fires might not happen. We need to solve our problems first before looking for other reasons. Each individual should contribute their own part in order to ameliorate the climate.

Ken’s point in the beginning of the video about what the effects are, (instead of what they will be) is an important one. Our climate is changing here and now, this change isn’t some mythical thing that will only spring in 2 or 3 decades but rather is a process occurring today. I was not aware that 20 people died in Montecito during a mudslide due to the Thomas Fire. This was surprising to me as I followed the news, and it had not made any major headlines. Probably the most astonishing thing I learned in the video was that the fires spreading in Australia right now are bigger than the 15 biggest wildfires in 21st century California combined. Not only are they merely bigger than all of those wildfires combined, but they are four times bigger. That statistics gave context and realism to the Australia fires to me. Before viewing Kens video and the documentary, the Australian fire did not really feel real to me. Australia is over 8000 miles away, I’ve never been anywhere even near the area. But viewing the documentary humanizes the issue for me. Seeing the survivors of the fire made the events of the fire feel vivid and visceral. 

 <br><br>
 I agree with your point about the film about how it demonstrated the destruction that the change in our climate can cause. Your point about how when events hit close is absolutely true. So many times, problems do not feel real until you are faced with its imminence. Like a student procrastinating on studying for an exam, as a species we are procrastinating on taking action towards remedying the problem of anthropegenic climate change. Only difference is magnitude,;if a student fails a course they can often retake it, we can't make a new planet. I will disagree with you on your absolution of blame towards PG&E. I would argue that PG&E can, and absolutely should be held responsible for its actions. They knew what they were doing, and persisted in their morally bankrupt actions due to corporate greed. However, this also does not absolve us from blame. For them to be held responsible, we should also have taken action sooner to prevent this from happening. 

 <br><br>

As a side note, I found the section of the documentary with the footage of the fire and the hospital to be very effective at eliciting an emotional response. If that was the documentary creators intention, I commend them for a job well done.

I did not expect such a contrast in feeling from the start to the end of the film. The progression of the seriousness of the Camp fire was shocking. Towards the beginning I truly believed that they could get the fire under control and that those in positions of authority knew what they were doing. I completely understand those people who were not aware that they were in such serious danger. I believe that I hopefully in that circumstance would be able to know when the time was to leave, but it is expected that when in danger they would be notified. In addition, conditions of the town itself aided the destruction and defeat of the city, but I kept on wondering what could have been done to help. There were many errors made on behalf of the fire department by not notifying the residents as well as the 911 operator, but the fact that there was only one road was one of the hardest obstacles to overcome. This led me to think that as prepared as any one city can expect to be, factors that are out of their control can easily mess up their entire plan. Being left to improvise, it is lucky that people were able to make it out of the fire under those circumstances. When I heard about the Camp fire prior to the film I was upset and worried, but watching the film opened my eyes to the horrifying experience that the Camp fire was. I could never imagine having to be in that situation myself and have to run through fire or struggle to breathe in my own city. Having had fires around my area around three times in the past two years did not expose me to the dismay that occured to the residents of Paradise. 
 <br><br>
When relating this to climate change and seeing that the rise of the global temperature greatly contributes to the seriousness and frequency of these fires, I feel almost hopeless. I understand the power of one and that decreasing my own carbon footprint will help halt the growth of many of the issues that come with climate change, but I have little to no faith in the actions of others changing. Due to the politics behind greenhouse gas emissions but also the economic production of meat in the US, I am fearful that we won't see change in time. I see potential in my generation to be the ones to help stop the growth of climate change, but many of my friends don't feel the same way I do about the issue. Some of my friends are in english twenty three as well and  we happen to bring up climate change in conversation. About half of our friends did not see climate change as an issue and claimed that it wouldn't affect them. As much as I want to have faith in my generation, I am nervous that we will fail to create the difference we need to see.

I agree that it was shocking how the fire developed into a great danger towards the homes and lives of people living in Paradise. Initially, no one had seemed to realize the great threat the fire would actually pose and didn't give it the attention it had warranted that possibly could have prevented much more damage. To me, this episode reflects how many regard the effects of climate change. Many people might very well believe that the threat of climate change is real, but don't realize that we are already being affected very much by the consequences of it. Climate change is not something that will happen, it is something that is already happening. To connect this with the Paradise fire, many of the residents knew that there was a fire near them, but did not realize that the fire was already spreading toward their residence until it was already too late. I also found it extremely unsettling when the episode showed the hospital being evacuated because the fire had struck way too close. One tends to regard hospitals as a place of safety and even refuge, but when even a place such as that becomes threatened by fires, it becomes terrifying when you feel you have nowhere else safe to go. As you mentioned, many of us can feel like we have prepared enough for natural disasters such as this, but when they get bigger and more dangerous each time, all our plans fall to waste because we can never fully prepare for them.
<br><br>
     The fact that four out of the five largest wildfires in California have happened within the last ten years is startling. And we only have humans to blame for this since (as stated in the video) human-caused climate change has doubled the rate of wildfires since 1984. It is sad to think that many people won't realize that natural disasters are becoming worse and worse each time because of our own actions until it is too late. As much as I can hope that people will come to their senses and realize that we need to drastically change our habits, I am afraid it won't happen until they are the ones that are personally affected.

 I too am nervous that our generation will fail to see the crisis and create the difference the world needs to see. After watching both the movie and the video I was shocked at how devastating the fires actually can be. I had only briefly heard of the fire that took down Paradise, but after watching that movie I was shocked and fearful of the dangers these wildfires are bringing. While we believe our wildfires are bad...which they truly are having caused so much devastation over the year...the fires in Australia are so much worse, 4 times worse than the damage caused from 15 of the US's worst fires. I believe that this movie/documentary should have been addressed to a larger audience. People do not go to movie theaters as much as they used to but I think that advertising films that can be emotionally impactful will bring more to the cause. Our generation needs to gain a fear of what is to come due to the impacts of their past relatives and they need to find strength in numbers in order to issue a change in the thinking of all those around them.  
<br><br>

This movie made my heart hurt knowing that 85 families lost a loved one due to a fallen electrical tower and lack of notice to the crisis. In a way I see this as a foreshadow of what will be our future. The fire came upon the citizens of Paradise extremely fast and within a short amount of time, the negative effects of greenhouse gas emissions has started showing its true colors after years of delay...if we don't start to change our ways the world can end up like the people in Paradise, in a disaster. I do not wish upon my future offspring and family any harm from my own carbon footprint and I would hate for them to be affected by my generation's footprint either. I believe that the world needs to find a more effective way to broadcast the incoming dangers and events that are to come our way due to the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I really like how you related the way people react to climate change to the way people initially reacted to the fire. Seeing that both started as something that was not believed to be serious but as time went on developed into large complex issues is a great way to relate the two. Some residents in Paradise unfortunately didn't realize the danger they were in until it was too late, and I feel that this directly corresponds with the attitude many people have about climate change in the present. Some are oblivious to the facts and science behind climate change or simply choose to ignore it.

<br><hr>
I agree that greater exposure of films like this could educate more people and hopefully allow for positive change to occur. I see your point with establishing fear into our generation so they feel more inclined to act, but I really hope that we can establish change without that.
